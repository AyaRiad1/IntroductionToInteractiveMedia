### Tuesday August 30, 2022
- Reminder that masks are required at all times indoors except when actively
  eating

#### Introduction to class
* Join Discord
* What are some examples of IM projects? 
	Spend a few minutes Googling 
	and put links in Discord
* What is IM?
	- Discussion
	- Read *What I hope for you* from
		Red Burns’ (founder of NYU's ITP) [Opening Remarks to New Students](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/focus-on-people-not-tech-and-other-impt-lessons-for-interaction-design-and-life/)
* Homework, projects, and grading
	- Most of you come into this class with different 
		backgrounds, skills, and knowledge, so 
		in IM, we grade by effort and progress, 
		not by a fixed level of accomplishment.
		- Challenge: How do I evaluate evaluate effort and progress? 
			- Ideas?
	- In IM we strongly encourage experimentation, thinking outside the box,
		and risk taking. 
		However taking risks is only possible 
		if failure doesn't have catastrophic results. 
		If failure results in a poor grade, 
		how does that encourage risk taking?
		- Suggestions?

* introductions

- Syllabus etc.
- **Connect to Zoom 10 minutes early**
	- This is to make sure you have time to fix any potential Zoom issues
	- You may keep your camera and mic turned off until class time

#### Let's get started

##### Simple shapes in p5.js

Open [p5.js editor](editor.p5.js/)

- `ellipse()`
- `rect()`
- `createCanvas()`
- `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
- `line()`
- `point()`

What does this all mean?
- Functions
- Arguments or parameters

Controlling color, fill, and stroke

- `stroke()`
- `noStroke()`
- `fill()`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 180)`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, radians(180), CHORD)`

[Here](https://editor.p5js.org/michaelshiloh/sketches/HYnL3E91x)
is the mouse location helper program I showed you at the end of class.

### Thursday September 1, 2022

##### More about programming

- Built-in variables
	- `mouseX`, `mouseY`
	- `width`, `height`
	- many others; we will discover more as we go along

##### Variables

- Javascript is not a typed language: you don't need to declare
	a variable's type
- `let myNumber = 4.5;`
- `let myString = "the quick brown fox";`
- `let myArray = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"];`
- `let myRandomNumber = random(255);`
- `let myRandomNumber = round(random(255));`
How can we find out what a variable's value is?
`print()` 

##### Animation

Use the `draw()` function to draw something different in each frame. This can
be the location of a shape but you can manipulate anything such as color also:

The  `draw()` function is called once per frame. Think of it as drawing a new
page on a ["flip book"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_book)

````
let foo = 0;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  foo = foo + 1;
}
````

By default, the previous frame is not erased. Sometimes this is useful.
Use the `background()` function to "paint" over any previous drawings. 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 500);
}

let triangleTopLeftX = 0;
let redValue = 255;

function draw() {
  // erase previous drawings
  background(10, 255, 255);

  // Move the triangle
  triangleTopLeftX = triangleTopLeftX + 1;

	// If the triangle reaches the right edge, move to the left edge
  if (triangleTopLeftX >= width) {
    triangleTopLeftX = 0;
  }

  // Change the value of red
  redValue = redValue - 1;

	//If red reaches a certian level, reset it
  if (redValue === 55) {
		redValue = 255;
	}

  // Select the fill for the triangle
  fill(redValue, redValue - 100, redValue - 100);

  // Draw the triangle
  triangle(
    triangleTopLeftX,
    20, // top left corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 100,
    30, // top right corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 50,
    200
  ); // bottom corner
  
  // Select the fill for the circle
  fill(10,20, 240);

  // Draw the circle
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 30);
  print("mouse coordinates = " + mouseX + ", " + mouseY);
}

````

##### Notes:

- Local vs. Global variables
- Built-in variables

````
// Example usage of a global variable

let count; // this is now a global variable

function setup() {
  circle(50, 50, 30);
  count = 7; // the variable is initialized here
}

function draw() {
  count = count + 1; // not algebra!
  // The result of the right hand side calculation
  // replaces whatever value was stored in the variable
  // on the left side of the '=' sign
  // end result: the variable "count" is incremented by 1

  print (count);
}
````
### Tuesday September 6, 2022

##### Any questions? Review last week if necessary

##### What is `frameRate()`?

````
function setup() {
  frameRate(10);       // frameRate() is a function
  print(frameRate()); // it takes awhile for the frame rate to change
}

function draw() {
  print(frameRate());
}
````

- conditionals 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed === true) {
    background(color(0, 0, 255));
  } else {
    background(color(200, 0, 0));
  }
}
````

**Notes**:
1. `mouseIsPressed` is another built-in variable. There are many others.
1. `mouseIsPressed` is a new type of data, namely a `boolean`, 
	which means it has
	 only one of two values, `true` or `false`
1. Note that `{` and `}` indicate the blocks
1. The `else` part of an `if()` statement is optional (what happens if we
	 remove it?)

In class exercise:
- Using the cursor to draw
- Now use a mouse press to clear the screen
- Clear the screen if the mouse is pressed inside a certain circle
- Combine these to create a primitive painting program

### Thursday September 8, 2022

##### Loops
- `while()` is like `if()` but it keeps on doing it as long as condition is true
	- Whereas `if()` does it only once
	- The assumption is that something changes while you're doing the loop which
		might eventually make the condition false, otherwise you'd be stuck there
		forever
- `for()` is a variation in structure but basically does the same

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  let foo = 50; // create and initialize a variable

  while (foo < width) { // keep going as long as the condition is true
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
		// modify the variable so something different happens next time
    foo = foo + 50; 
  }
}
````

1. You should get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your variables.
	1. What is a better name for the variable foo?
1. What would happen if you replace the `while()` with `if()`?

There is another way to make a loop using the keyword `for()`. The `for()`
loop structure combines the initialization step and the incrementation step
into the `for()` loop construction:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  }
}
````

Which should you use? Whichever is easier for you to understand. Remember that
**most of the time spent programming is fixing problems**, and **whatever you
understand best will probably have fewer problems**.

Both `for()` loops and `while()` loops can be nested, meaning a loop inside a
loop:

````

function setup() {
  createCanvas(700, 700);
  background(230);
  fill(0);

  let yPos = 0;
  let xPos = 0;

  for (yPos = 30; yPos < height; yPos=yPos + 40) {
    for (xPos = 20; xPos<width; xPos=xPos + 40) {
      circle(xPos,yPos, 5);
    }
  }
}

````

Note that I've done all the above examples in `setup()` and not in `draw()`

#### Functions

Every time you use one of the built-in 'commands', you are really using (or
more properly 'calling') a built-in function. Functions are a very important
building block of programming, and in addition to using built-in functions,
you can also create your own. In fact, you've already been doing that, when
you created the `setup()` and `draw()` functions. In the case of
`setup()` and `draw()` you have to use those names, but when you create other
functions you can make up your own names. Just like variables names, good 
function names make your programs easier to understand.

Why create your own functions?

- Reuse (if it's something you might do again)
- Clarity (remember your three important audiences: yourself, others learning
	from you, me when I grade your work)
- Easier to debug (what is debugging?)
	- One of the most powerful ways to approach
	a bug is to reproduce it with simplest possible example. 
	This is much easier when the thing that's causing
	the problem is already a function.
- Modularity
- Flexibility (with good choice of parameters)

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    rect(foo, 50, 40, 40);
    line(foo, 50, foo+20, 30);
    line(foo+20, 30, foo+40, 50);
  }
}
````

Now let's make a function called `drawOneHouse()`. If we want to
draw a house at different locations, we need a way to tell
the function `drawOneHouse()` where to put the house. Functions accommodate
this by allowing us to pass information into the function by putting 
that information in the parenthesis. In the function, we store this
information in temporary variables that we can use in the function:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50) {
    drawOneHouseAt(foo);
  }
}

function drawOneHouseAt( x) {
  rect(x, 50, 40, 40);
  line(x, 50, x+20, 30);
  line(x+20, 30, x+40, 50);
}
````

**Notes**
1. I've said this before and I'll keep saying: 
	**Choose descriptive names for your variables and functions!** 
	`foo` is a bad name, `xPos` is a good name,
	 `houseXPos` is a better name.
1. The value of `foo` (50, 100, 150 ...) is the information passed to the
	 function so that the function can do it's work. The proper name for this
	 information is an **argument**
1. The variable `x` is a temporary variable that **only exists in the function**.
	 This variable is used to store the argument that was passed into the
	 function so that the function can do its work. Once the function is
	 finished, this variable is no longer needed and is destroyed. 
	 A variable used in this way is called a **parameter**
1. Functions may take zero, one, or multiple arguments. When you write 
	a function, you decide how many arguments you need. For example, we might
	have included the house size or roof height or house y location. (Of course
	when you use functions that someone else wrote 
	you must use the proper number of parameters.)
1. Functions can return information as well, for example the `random()`
	 function. Functions can either return one piece of information, or none.
	We will see later how to do this. 

#### Variable Scope (again)

````
let foo;  // this is a global variable, visible in all functions

function setup() {
  foo = 7;
}

function draw() {

  print(foo);

  let bar; // this is a local variable, visible only inside of draw()

  for (let i = 0; i < width/2; i++) { 
    // i is a local variable visible only inside this for() loop
    ellipse(i, height/2, 10,15);
  }
}
````

#### Arrays

[Really simple array
example](https://editor.p5js.org/michaelshiloh/sketches/8TB1ONGFA)


Why is it better to write:

```
 if ("d" == key) {
```

rather than:

```
 if (key == "d") {
```

#### Object oriented programming

Now let's create one from scratch. 
1. First, let's make a ball bounce off all 4 walls of the canvas
2. Identify carefully and isolate what's in `setup()`, 
	what does the moving, and what does the drawing

Let's modify the functions (both constructor and member functions) to take
arguments

```
// Commented out is the way this would work without classes
// let xPos, yPos, xSpeed, ySpeed;

// function setup() {
//   createCanvas(400, 400);
//   xPos = width / 2;
//   yPos = random(100, 300);
//   xSpeed = 4;
//   ySpeed = 7;
// }

// function draw() {
//   background(220);

//   // move the ball
//   xPos += xSpeed;
//   yPos += ySpeed;

//   // check for collisions
//   // check first for left and right wall
//   if (xPos <= 15 || xPos >= (width-15)) {
//     xSpeed = -xSpeed;
//   }

//   // do the same for the ceiling and the floor
//   if (yPos <= 15 || yPos >= (height-15)) {
//     ySpeed = -ySpeed;
//   }

//   circle(xPos, yPos, 30);
// }

3. Now carefully write the class:
	1. The code in `setup()` is most likely the *constructor*
	1. The moving code and the drawing code are most likely 
		the two member functions you'll need
1. Look at the example we did and see how to create the object from the class,
	 and how to call the member functions at the right times
class BouncingBall {
  constructor() {
    this.xPos = width / 2;
    this.yPos = random(100, 300);
    this.xSpeed = 4;
    this.ySpeed = 7;
  }

  move() {
    // move the ball
    this.xPos += this.xSpeed;
    this.yPos += this.ySpeed;
  }

  checkForCollisions() {
    // check first for left and right wall
    if (this.xPos <= 15 || this.xPos >= width - 15) {
      this.xSpeed = -this.xSpeed;
    }

    // do the same for the ceiling and the floor
    if (this.yPos <= 15 || this.yPos >= height - 15) {
      this.ySpeed = -this.ySpeed;
    }
  }

  draw() {
    circle(this.xPos, this.yPos, 30);
  }
}

let myBouncingBall;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  myBouncingBall = new BouncingBall();
}

function draw() {
  background(240);
  myBouncingBall.move();
  myBouncingBall.checkForCollisions();
  myBouncingBall.draw();
}

````

Go over [this](https://p5js.org/examples/objects-objects.html) example

[Here](https://editor.p5js.org/mangtronix/sketches/-7sWqG_Bu) is one solution

##### In class exercise
Write your own class to do something, perhaps inspired by the computer
graphics homework you just did. Start with something very simple, and slowly
add features. Or, do this:

Make a class that draws a square in the middle of the screen, and have it
slowly give the effect of breathing: slowly change size a little bigger and a
little smaller, and slowly change color slightly, at about the same rate of
breathing

How to use the modulo function to make something happen less often than every
frame: 

```
let shade = 0;
let amount = 5;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(shade);

  // change the shade only on every other frame
  if (frameCount % 2 == 0) {
    shade += amount;

    // make sure the shade stays between 0 and 255
    if (shade <= 0 || shade >= 255) {
      amount = -amount;
    }
  }
}
```

Now we learn about arrays. There is an example
[here](https://p5js.org/examples/arrays-array.html) but unfortunately it is a
little complex. The important things to notice are:
1. Creating the array `let ball = [];` the `[]` is what tells p5 that you're
	 making an array
2. Filling the array is what determines the size:
```
    if (this.xPos <= 15 || this.xPos >= width - 15) {
			ball[i] = new BouncingBall(i + 1, 2);
    }
```
Since we have put 10 values into the array, the array has 10 elements in it

Similarly, to access any element in the array you index into the array:
```
// Refer to the third element in the array (remember the index starts at 0):
ball[2];
```

Here then is the bouncing ball example, this time creating 10 
balls, and storing them in an array:

```
class BouncingBall {
  constructor(xSpeed0, ySpeed0) {
    this.xPos = width / 2;
    this.yPos = random(100, 300);
    this.xSpeed = xSpeed0;
    this.ySpeed = ySpeed0;
  }

  move() {
    // move the ball
    this.xPos += this.xSpeed;
    this.yPos += this.ySpeed;
  }

  checkForCollisions() {
    // check first for left and right wall
    if (this.xPos <= 15 || this.xPos >= width - 15) {
      this.xSpeed = -this.xSpeed;
    }

    // do the same for the ceiling and the floor
    if (this.yPos <= 15 || this.yPos >= height - 15) {
      this.ySpeed = -this.ySpeed;
    }
  }

  draw() {
    circle(this.xPos, this.yPos, 30);
  }
}

let ball = [];

function setup() {
  
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // each ball will have a slightly different
    // initial speed in the X axis, but all balls
    // will have the same speed in the Y axis
    ball[i] = new BouncingBall(i + 1, 2);
  }
}

function draw() {
  background(240);

  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ball[i].move();
    ball[i].checkForCollisions();
    ball[i].draw();
  }
}
```

[Here](https://p5js.org/examples/arrays-array-objects.html)
is another example showing how to make an array of objects

### Thursday September 15, 2022

#### Review Object oriented programming and arrays
- Classes are like cookie cutters; objects are like cookies
	- Naming conventions
- Classes contain both properties (size, color, speed, position, etc.) and
	behaviours (move, draw, bounce, etc.)

- Solutions to Tuesday's in-class exercise
	- How to make the box "pause" when it's off
	- How to center the box
- Aaron's [car](https://editor.p5js.org/aaronsherwood/sketches/eYFQE9EZa) 
	example
	- How to make the car "bump" a little

Maybe now we are prepared to analyze 
[this](https://p5js.org/examples/arrays-array-objects.html)
example. Sometimes it's good to go back to something that looked 
impossible earlier, to see whether it makes sense now (and to see how much
you've already learned!)

#### Look at next week's homework assignment
- Push your boundries! Try to do something you don't quite understand, bring
	it to class, and let's see if we can figure out how to do it
- Remember to save your code! 
- If you try different approaches, save them all, and describe them
	all in your blog post. Include those that work (if there are any)
	and those that don't work (if there are any).
	(You could name them September20_1, September20_2, or even
	September20_arraysBroken, September20_classesWorks)

#### Look at some more computer graphic assignments
- In particular, those that didn't quite do what you wanted

### Tuesday September 20, 2022

#### Make up discussion from last week
- Casey Reas: Mohamed Alhosani will lead the discussion

#### Transformations
Transformations move the coordinate system
so you can draw in different places with the same code
- Available 2D transforms are 
	- `translate()`
	- `rotate()`
	- `scale()`
- `push()` and `pop()` allow you to remember where the canvas was, 
and then return to it's last position

Example: Draw a house at a given location, no transform:

````
function house(int x, int y)
{
  triangle(x + 15, y, x, y + 15, x + 30, y + 15);
  rect(x, y + 15, 30, 30);
  rect(x + 12, y + 30, 10, 15);
}
````

Same result, but using a transform:

````
function house(x, y)
{
  translate(x, y);
  triangle(15, 0, 0, 15, 30, 15);
  rect(0, 15, 30, 30);
  rect(12, 30, 10, 15);
}
````

Why do this?
- Easier to read
- Easier to code complex motions relative to other motions

**Notes**
- Just like with `fill()` and `rectMode()`, once you've moved the origin it
	stays there unless you return it to its starting position. E.g. try putting
	a circle in the center of the canvas `ellipse (width/2, height/2, 20);`
- Whenever you do a transformation, it's good practice to **always** return
	the origin to where it was before using `push()` and `pop()`:

````
function house(x, y)
{
  push();
  translate(x, y);
  triangle(15, 0, 0, 15, 30, 15);
  rect(0, 15, 30, 30);
  rect(12, 30, 10, 15);
  pop();
}
````

*Suggestion*
- I encourage you to see what the other section is up to; the other teacher and
I often exchange ideas and build on each other's examples and lectures. In
particular, Mang has curated a very nice list of [Additional
Resources](https://github.com/mangtronix/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#week-22-additional-resources)
on transformations.

##### Rotation and scaling 

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400,400);
  background(240);

  // the red rectangle is drawn before the rotation so
  // it will stay in place
  fill(255, 0, 0);
  rect(200, 200, 100, 100);
  line(0, 0, 200, 200);

  // Now a green rectangle
  fill(0, 255, 0);

  // rotation is done here. all subsequent drawing
  // is done post-rotation
  rotate(radians(10));

  // the green rectangle is drawn after rotating the canvas
  rect(200, 200, 100, 100);
  line(0, 0, 200, 200);
}
```

Work through 
[this](https://genekogan.com/code/p5js-transformations/) resource

#### Text

Basic default text:

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);

  text("My Important Message", width / 2, height / 2);
}
```

Picking fonts:

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  textFont("Courier New", 25);

  text("My Important Message", width / 2, height / 2);
}
```

There are of course many other things you can do with text. You can look at Help->Reference->Typography and File->Examples->Typography for ideas and examples.

Some advanced examples using text are
[here](https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/tree/master/processingExamples)

Some awesome examples alas without code:
- https://www.syedrezaali.com/generative-typography-experiments/

##### Data Visualization

What is data visualization? Here are some examples:

- [Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/allstreets/)
- [Aaron Koblin](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/project/flight-patterns)
- [Jer Thorp](https://www.jerthorp.com/portfolio) e.g. Just Landed

###### Finding data

Sources

- https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/
- https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/rt_data_access.shtml
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
- Professor Mathura's 
	[list of data sources](https://github.com/MathuraMG/ConnectionsLabSpring22/blob/master/Week_3_JSON_Fetch/README.md#list-of-data-sources)
 	
Format

- The most common format is CSV, especially as you can use any spreadsheet
	(Excel, OpenOffice Calc, Google Sheets) to export any table in CSV format
- Other formats are JSON and XML. We won't spend much time on them, but there
	are p5.js libraries available for parsing them


##### Worked example: Getting and working with a CSV file

- A [database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/) of energy generated by wind turbines
- Click "Get Data"
- Scroll down a bit to "Tabular Data: CSV format" and click on "CSV
format".
	- This will download a `.zip` file.
- Unzip the file.
	- This will create `uswtdb_v4_1_20210721.csv`
- This is a plain text file; you can view it with a text editor
	- You will see that the first line is the heading of each column
	- Some of the fields are numerical (e.g. case_id)
	- Some of the fields are text (e.g. t_state, t_county)
	- Some of the fields are missing (e.g. faa_ors, faa_asn)
- Upload the file into your sketch (Sketch Files -> Upload Files)
- Now you can load this file into an array of `Strings` and then process each
	line one at a time, pulling out individual fields:

````
/*

// An array of strings to hold the entire file
let strings = [];

// For scaling, we want to know the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude
let minLat;
let maxLat;
let minLong;
let maxLong;

function preload() {
  // The text from the file is loaded into an array.
  strings = loadStrings("uswtdb_v4_3_20220114.csv");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 400);

  // Did we succeed to load anything?
  if (strings == null) {
    print("failed to load the file, stopping here");

    // this is an endless loop; it's a common way

    // something is so wrong that there is no sense
    // in continuing
    while (true) {}
  }

  print(
    "strings loaded from file successfully, read " + strings.length + " lines"
  );

  // Find the minimum and maximum latitude
  // and longitude
  findMinMaxLatLong();
}

function findMinMaxLatLong() {
  let singleRow = [];

  // loop over each row in the file

    // get a single row and split that row
    // into individual words
    singleRow = split(strings[csvRowNumber], ",");

    // We know that the last two fields are the
    // latitude and longitude and so they are
    // numerical:
    let longitude = float(singleRow[25]);
    let latitude = float(singleRow[26]);

    // The file may be missing a field, in which case
    // the converstion to a float might have failed
    if (isNaN(longitude) || isNaN(latitude)) {
      print("conversion to float failed; skipping row " + csvRowNumber);
    } else {
      if (csvRowNumber == 1) {
        minLat = latitude - 10;
        maxLat = latitude + 10;
        minLong = longitude - 10;

  print("Latitude (min, max) = (" + minLat + "," + maxLat + ") ");
  print("Longitude (min, max) = (" + minLong + "," + maxLong + ")");
} // end of findMinMaxLatLong

let csvRowNumber = 1;
// Skip the first line, since we know it's a header

function draw() {
  let singleRow = [];

  // get a single row and split that row into
  // individual words

  // This really slows things
  // down so use only when debugging
  //print("Row " +
  // csvRowNumber +
  //   " contains " +
  //   singleRow.length +
  //   " fields" );

  // We know that the last two fields are the
  // latitude and longitude and so they are
  // numerical:
  let longitude = float(singleRow[25]);
  let latitude = float(singleRow[26]);

  // use only when debugging
  // print("Latitude " +
  // latitude +
  //   " longitude " +
  //   longitude );

  // Check for non-numerical strings.
  if (isNaN(longitude) || isNaN(latitude)) {
    print("conversion to float failed; skipping row " + csvRowNumber);
  } else {
    // scale that to fit on our canvas
    //print(csvRowNumber);
    let ypos = map(latitude, minLat, maxLat, 0, height);
    let xpos = map(longitude, minLong, maxLong, 0, width);

    // Put a mark there
    point(xpos, ypos);
  } // end of valid data

  csvRowNumber++;
  if (csvRowNumber >= strings.length) {
    print("finished");
    noLoop();
  }
}

````


Things to notice:
1. The `split()` function does half the magic
1. The `int()` or `float()` function does much of the rest
1. Data files might have errors in them and you need to defend your program
	 against them
1. `loop()` and `noLoop()` can be used anytime you want to start or stop the
	 `draw()` function from repeating


##### JSON and XML: Other file formats

JSON and XML are other format for organizing data in a file.
They are more complex than CSV, and again p5.js provides functions.

#### Discussion 
The Art of Interactive Design: Ahmad Fraij and Hamad

##### Generative Text
Pull words from a CSV file
and by using `random()` in a clever way,
write poems or slogans or whatever.

Here is a terribly lame example:

````
/*
Generate poetry from a file of words
 the file has words in this format:

 roses,red,violets,blue,dream,disneyland

 we will refer to them as:

 item1,color1,item2,color2,verb,location

 and construct a poem:

 item1 are color1, item2 are color2
 when I verb I verb to location
 */

// Let's put the index of the word into numbers:
const ITEM1 = 0;
const COLOR1 = 1;
const ITEM2 = 2;
const COLOR2 = 3;
const VERB = 4;
const LOCATION = 5;
// final means that I will not change these variables
// It is conventional to use all caps for variable names that will not change


let strings = [];

function setup() {

  // The text from the file is loaded into an array.
  strings = loadStrings("words.csv");

  // How many lines did we get?
 // print("strings array contains this many lines: " + strings.length);
}

let csvRowNumber = 0;

function draw() {
  let singleRow = [];

  // First line: "item1 are color1, item2 are color2"

  // Pick a random number, round that number DOWN to a whole number,
  // and split that row into individual words
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get item1
  let item1 = singleRow[ITEM1] + " are " ;

  // Now keep doing this for each word
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get color1
  let color1 = singleRow[COLOR1] + ", " ;

  // Now the second half of the first line: "violets are blue"
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  let item2 = singleRow[ITEM2] + " are " ;
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get color2
  let color2 =  singleRow[COLOR2];

  // that's the end of the first line of the poem
  print(item1 + " are " + color1 ", " + item2 + " are " + color2);

  // Now the second line: when I verb I verb of location

  message = "When I " ;
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[VERB]);
  print(" I " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[VERB]);
  print(" to the " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[LOCATION]);

  // that's the end of the second line of the poem so start a new line
  // and also put an extra blank line
  print('\n');
  print('\n');

  noLoop(); // Wait for a mouse click then do it again
}

// If you click the mouse, allow the draw() function to resume
function mouseClicked() {
  loop();
}
````

and this is an example of the words you can feed it.
put these contents into a file called `words.csv`:

```
roses,red,violets,blue,dream,disneyland
robots,silver,pencils,grey,run,supermarket
goldfish,orange,motors,white,turn,workbench
books,multicolored,lamposts,azure,swim,island
computers,black,mice,pink,squeak,home
```

#### More Data Visualization and generative text (Time permitting):

- have students make a scroller in pairs
- add randomness/perlin noise
- have them look at circle letters, 
	come up with questions and explanations in pairs
- have students work through example on their own and use data
- show generative word from circles sketch

### Tuesday September 27, 2022

#### Finish Data Visualization
#### Finish Generative Text

#### Working with images!

The `p5.Image` class
- Just another class, i.e. it has
	- Data (the pixels, width, height, etc.)
	- Functionality `(image()`, `get()`, etc.)

````
let photo;
function preload() {
  photo = loadImage("https://placekitten.com/400/400");
}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(255);
  image(photo, 0, 0); // this actually displays the image
}
````

- `image(photo, positionX, positionY, width, height)` - display 
this image at this location and scale to this size
- `photo.resize(w,h)` - scale to this size. If one of the arguments is zero,
	then scale to the remaining argument and retain the original aspect ratio.
- `photo.get(x,y,w,h)` - Returns a new p5.Image containing a portion of the image
- `photo.get(x,y)` - Returns the color of the pixel at this location

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(255);
  image(catImg, 0, 0);

  let newImg = catImg.get( 50,60, 100,100);
  image (newImg, 20, 80);
}
```

#### More fun with images and introduction to sound

- Pixels array
- Sprite sheets
- Sound
- Introduce midterm project

#### The `pixels` array: Treating the canvas as an image

You can access individual pixels 
from the canvas (and whatever is on the canvas)
using the special built-in array called `pixels`. 
Before using this array you must load everything from the canvas 
into the `pixels` array using the `loadPixels()` function, 
and after making any changes you must call `updatePixels()` 
to write from the `pixels` array back to the canvas
if you want to make the changes visible

```
function setup() {
  let pink = color(255, 102, 204);
  loadPixels();
  let d = pixelDensity();
  let halfImage = 4 * (width * d) * ((height / 2) * d);
  for (let i = 0; i < halfImage; i += 4) {
    pixels[i] = red(pink);
    pixels[i + 1] = green(pink);
    pixels[i + 2] = blue(pink);
    pixels[i + 3] = alpha(pink);
  }
  updatePixels();
}
```

- The pixels array is one-dimensional, 
meaning if you want to go to a different row on the canvas 
you need to offset by that many widths
- Each pixel occupies 4 positions in the array
- Thus the equation for accessing a given pixel is
   (x + y * width) * 4
- Remember to set `pixelDensity(1);` in case you have a high 
resolution display


```
function setup() {
  pixelDensity(1);

  // blue background 
  // makes it easier to see the pink
  background(0, 102, 204);

  loadPixels();

  // Here is the equation 
  // for the start (red value) 
  // of a pixel 
  // at a particular coordinate (x,y)
  // (x + y*width) * 4

  // Change most of the fiftieth row to pink
  // instead of the whole line, 
  // only do from x = 10 to x = 90
  let startX = 10;
  let endX = 90;
  let row = 50;

  for (let i = (startX + 50 * width) * 4;
       i < (endX + 50 * width) * 4;
       i += 4) {

    // pink
    pixels[i + 0] = 255;
    pixels[i + 1] = 102;
    pixels[i + 2] = 204;
    pixels[i + 3] = 100;
  }

  // this puts the array back on the screen
  updatePixels();
}
```

It's important to remember that a pixel is just four numbers
so you can manipulate pixels mathematically 
e.g. make it fade:

````
function setup() {
  pixelDensity(1);
  background(0, 102, 204);
}

let redValue = 0; 

function draw() {

  loadPixels();
  
  for (let i = 0; i < width * height * 4 ; i+=4) {
    pixels[i] = redValue;
  } 
  updatePixels();

  redValue = (redValue + 1 ) %255
  print(redValue);
  
  updatePixels();

}
````

Just for fun, here is the last example from the video where Dan
created a random (only in the green channel) background:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(256,256);
  pixelDensity(1);
}

function draw() {
  loadPixels();
  for (var y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    for (var x = 0; x < width; x++) {
      var index = (x + y * width) * 4;

      pixels[index + 0] = x;
      // red value changes horizontally

      pixels[index + 1] = random(255);
      // green value random

      pixels[index + 2] = y;
      // blue value changes vertically

      pixels[index + 3] = 255;
      // no transparency
    }
  }
  updatePixels();
}
````

Look at the reference page for the pixels array

A fun examples from Professor Sherwood:

![](media/circularImages.png)

Get the original image [here](media/aiweiwei.jpeg)

```
let tiles = [];
let tileSize = 100;

function preload() {
  img = loadImage("aiweiwei.jpeg");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  let numTiles = img.height / tileSize;
  while (numTiles > 0) {
    tiles.push(
      img.get(
        int(random(img.width - tileSize)),
        int(random(img.height - tileSize)),
        tileSize,
        tileSize
      )
    );
    numTiles--;
  }
  imageMode(CENTER);
}

function draw() {
  push();
  translate(width / 2, height / 2);

  let numSegments = 10;
  let eachAngle = TWO_PI / numSegments;
  let whichImage = int(random(tiles.length));

  for (let i = 0; i < numSegments; i++) {
    let x = cos(eachAngle * i) * tileSize + 1;
    let y = sin(eachAngle * i) * tileSize + 1;
    push();
    translate(x, y);
    rotate(eachAngle * i);
    image(tiles[whichImage], 0, 0);
    pop();
  }

  pop();
  noLoop();
}

function keyPressed() {
  loop();
}
```

Can we use a sequence of images for animation?

![](media/walking.png)


Download this to your laptop: 
https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/media/walking.png

How would we use them?

````
let spritesheet;
let sprites = [];
let direction = 1; // 0 up
let step = 0;
let x;
let y;
let speed = 3;

function preload() {
  spritesheet = loadImage("walking.png");
}

function setup() {
  // fullscreen(true);
  createCanvas(500, 450);

  // 12 images across, 4 down, in the spritesheet

  let w = int(spritesheet.width / 12);
  let h = int(spritesheet.height / 4);

  for (let y = 0; y < 4; y++) {
    sprites[y] = [];
    for (let x = 0; x < 12; x++) {
      sprites[y][x] =
        spritesheet.get(x * w, y * h, w, h);
    } // iterate over rows
  } // iterate over columns

  x = width / 2;
  y = height / 2;

  imageMode(CENTER);

	// Display first sprite
  image(sprites[direction][step], x, y);
}

// nothing to do here because all the action
// happens in the keyPressed() callback
function draw() {}

function keyPressed() {
  // look at sprite sheet to determine 
  // which direction is which row

  if (keyCode === DOWN_ARROW) {
    direction = 0;
    y += speed;
  }

  if (keyCode === LEFT_ARROW) {
    direction = 1;
    x -= speed;
  }

  if (keyCode === RIGHT_ARROW) {
    direction = 2;
    x += speed;
  }

  if (keyCode === UP_ARROW) {
    direction = 3;
    y -= speed;
  }

	// Every so often 
	// advance to the next sprite
  if (frameCount % speed == 0) {
    step = (step + 1) % 12;
  }

	// Finally draw paint the sprite
  background(255);
  image(sprites[direction][step], x, y);
}

````

You can probably find many sprite sheets by googling "sprite sheet" +
whatever you want.

(One possible solution to in-class exercise:)

```
let tiles = [];
let tileSize = 200;

function preload() {
  img = loadImage("aiweiwei.jpeg");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  let numTiles = 10;
  while (numTiles > 0) {
    tiles.push(
      img.get(
        int(random(img.width - tileSize)),
        int(random(img.height - tileSize)),
        tileSize,
        tileSize
      )
    );
    numTiles--;
  }
  imageMode(CENTER);
}

function draw() { }

function keyPressed() {
  image(tiles[int(random(10))], 0, 0);
}
```

    print("song is not playing")
    noLoop
  }
}

function mouseClicked() {
  if (song.isPlaying()) {
    song.stop();
  } else {
    song.play();
  }
}
````

As always, it's useful to explore the examples and the reference page

- Sound examples
	- File -> Examples -> Sound
		- Record Save
		- Live Input

**Remember**
Sound requires a separate library which must be included
in `index.html`

##### Sound Synthesis

The other way to make sounds is to create them mathematically

- Sound examples
	- File -> Examples -> Sound
		- Oscillator Waveform
		- Filters

We can create our own complex sounds starting with basic oscillators and then
changing the envelopes. 

##### Working in groups (time permitting):
If we had multiple sound files, how would we play the
next one when we click the mouse?

#### Working with a camera: Computer Vision!

Basic sketch showing how to get input from camera:

```
let capture;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
  capture = createCapture(VIDEO);
  capture.hide();
}

function draw() {
  image(capture, // what image to display
        0, 0,    // where to place the image on the canvas
        width,   // width to display

        // the height is more complicated:
        // we want the capture height to be
        // the width multiplied by the aspect ratio
        width * capture.height / capture.width);
}
```

Frame Differencing

- [Simple frame differencing](https://editor.p5js.org/michaelshiloh/sketches/ZqXC5-6M0), similar to the method in Golan Levin's article
- A more complex
	[example](https://editor.p5js.org/aaronsherwood/sketches/uxNAkReWT) by Prof.
	Aaron that uses frame differencing to detect which vertical slice of the
	camera image has the most motion, and trigger a corresponding sound clip

Other video tricks

- Video [Mirror](https://editor.p5js.org/aaronsherwood/sketches/cK59ueQ6a) (flipping the x)

- Color tracking

#### In class exercises
- If you wanted to display white (instead of the color of the difference)
	wherever motion above a certain threshold is detected, how would you do this?
- Can you trigger sounds according to where there is
	motion? You may start with Aaron's complex example and simplify
	[here](https://editor.p5js.org/aaronsherwood/sketches/uxNAkReWT)

##### Introduction to Arduino

- IDE
- `blink`
- What role does Arduino play?
- Switches and other sensors
- LEDs and other actuators
- Inputs and outputs
- Electricity
- Circuits
- Schematics
- Series and Parallel

#### Electricity 

**Simple circuit using Arduino, LED, and Resistor**

The most confusing part of this lecture will be the solderless breadboard:
![](media/breadboard.jpg)
Image courtesy of
[SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)

Here is how to build the circuit

![](media/ArduinoPoweringLED_bb.png)


**Theory**

Electricity is mysterious

- We can predict what it will do quite accurately, but don't really understand
	it what is it
- Flow of electrons
- Electrons want to move from place of higher potential energy to place of lower potential energy
	- Like a rock or water falling from a height
	- Unlike a rock or water, electricity can only travel in a conductor
- AC vs. DC - very briefly, will discuss more as it comes up

What makes a circuit?

- Something to provide that difference in potential 
that will cause the electrons to want to move. 
	- Typically a battery, charger, or USB port
	- The technical term is "power supply"
	- In our case your laptop via the Arduino
		- What is the Arduino doing in this case?
- Conductors to allow the electronics to move
- Components or other things that usually convert this electrical energy 
to some other form of energy (e.g. light, sound, heat, movement)
- Optionally, switches or other sensors to control the flow of energy
	- In our circuit the resistor is controlling the brightness of the LED so that it doesn't burn out

#### Schematics

Here is the schematic of what you've built

![](media/ArduinoPoweringLED_schem.png)

- Important part of something, 
	without getting distracted by details (e.g. subway maps)
- What's important in an electrical schematic?
	- Where is the power coming from?
	- What other components are there in the circuit?
	- How are they connected?

**Schematics are an important way to show a circuit. You will be required to
understand and use them**

#### Switches

- What if we want to turn it the LED on and off?
 	- Pull out a wire
 	- That's a switch, but a pretty inconvenient one
	- Schematic symbol of switch
	- How does it work?
		- Breaks the flow of electrons by breaking the continuous path
		- Doesn't electricity (the electrons) just flow out the end of the wire?
	- The switch can go on either side. How is this possible?

Let's use a real switch

![](media/ArduinoPoweringLEDWithSwitch_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoPoweringLEDWithSwitch_bb.png)

- How is this switch different from the earlier switch?
	- Schematic symbol of momentary switch
	- What was the previous "switch"?
	- Schematic symbol of toggle switch

#### Series and Parallel

- What if we put two LEDs or switches in?
- Two different ways: 

Series: All the current (electrons) must go through both components, one after
the other. 
![](media/ArduinoPowering2LEDSeries_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoPowering2LEDSeries_bb.png)

Parallel: Both components experience the same voltage difference
![](media/ArduinoPowering2LEDparallel_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoPowering2LEDparallel_bb.png)

- Any components can be connected in series or parallel; not just LEDs or
	switches
- Components might be in series, or parallel, or neither
- Components in series have the same **current** flowing through them
- Components in parallel have the same **voltage** across them
- No matter how many components you have in a circuit, and how they are
	connected, they will obey these principles.

#### Ohm's law
- I=V/R
- The math only works for linear components 
	- But the principle is the same for non-linear components 
	- **is a very important concept**:
		- For a given resistance, 
			the higher the pressure (voltage), 
				the higher the current
		- For a given voltage, the higher the "resistance", 
			the lower the current

![](media/electricityExplained.jpg)

#### Arduino finally!

Make sure everything is working

- Upload the Blink example
- Change the parameter in delay()
- Upload again and verify that the LED blinks at the new rate

#### Basic Arduino and Digital Output

Upload File -> Examples -> Basic -> Blink example

Let's extend this circuit to the breadboard:

![](media/ArduinoControllingLED_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoControllingLED_bb.png)

### Thursday October 27, 2022

Review

- Code
- Circuit
- Input and Output (I/O) pins
	- 20 IO pins
	- All 20 pins can do digital input and digital output
	- Many of the pins have additional special functionality
- Built-in LED
	- On the Arduino Uno this LED is on pin 13
	- On the Arduino Uno LED_BUILTIN = 13 

#### Digital Input

Adding a switch

![](media/ArduinoLEDMomentarySwitch_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoLEDMomentarySwitch_bb.png)

````
void setup() {
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(A2, INPUT);
}

void loop() {

  int switchPosition = digitalRead(A2);

  if (switchPosition == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(8, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  } else  {
    digitalWrite(8, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  }
}
````

An example:

````

const int pushButton = A2;
const int redLEDPin = A0;
const int greenLEDPin = 8;

void setup() {
  pinMode(redLEDPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenLEDPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {

  int buttonState = digitalRead(pushButton);

  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(redLEDPin, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(greenLEDPin, HIGH);
    delay(500);
    digitalWrite(greenLEDPin, LOW);
    delay(300);
    digitalWrite(redLEDPin, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenLEDPin, HIGH);
    delay(700);
  }
  allOff();
  delay(1000);
}

void allOff() {
  digitalWrite(redLEDPin, LOW);
  digitalWrite(greenLEDPin, LOW);
}
````

Other things you can do:

Add another LED on a different pin

![](media/ArduinoTwoLEDs_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoTwoLEDs_bb.png)

Add another switch on a different pin

![](media/ArduinoTwoSwitches_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoTwoSwitches_bb.png)

#### In-class exercise

Now write a program that will blink different patterns depending on which
switch is pressed. 
Using two switches you can select between four patterns.
How is that possible?

### Tuesday November 1, 2022

#### Feedback
- Don't include the full code of your assignment in your blog posts
- Better comments
- Better names for variables, functions, classes, and objects

#### Analogue Input

Build this circuit. Try to follow the schematic and not the breadboard view:

![](media/ArduinoPhotoresistor_schem.png)
![](media/ArduinoPhotoresistor_bb.png)

- Analogue Inputs, `analogRead()`, and (some) sensors go together
	- This only works on the six analog input pins (A0-A5)
	- Digital sensors, like a switch, have only one of two values 
	and so are more suited to a digital input
- Remember that the so-called analog input pins can do digital input and
	output as well
- Since you have so few analog input pins, when you decide which pins to use
	for which device, reserve the analog input pins for analog input devices
	as much as possible

Do you see a similarity between this circuit and 
something we learned earlier?

Some analogue sensors are resistive, some are not. 
Resistive sensors all use the same
pattern: a voltage divider.
Note the similarity to the circuit we used for a switch - 
the switch circuit is also effectively a voltage divider, one that has only
two values instead of an infinite range of values

What other sensors do we have in the kit?

Which ones are resistive?

#### Potentiometer

[Here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v41/circuit-1b-potentiometer)

#### Misc
- Hand drawn schematics in your homework are fine!
Here is an example:

![](media/handDrawnSchematicExample.jpg)

- Hand drawn switches can use the simple symbol
- Resources are available to help you with homework (me, Jack), but only
	if you start your homework early enough. If you wait until the last minute
	and then don't have time to get help, that is unexcusable.
- Use constants for pin numbers

#### Analogue Output

- Analogue Outputs, `analogWrite()`, PWM and (some) actuators go together
	- `analogWrite()` only works on the six PWM pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11).
	- LEDs, motors, and some other actuators respond properly to PWM
	- Other actuators, like a solenoid, do not respond well to PWM and really
		should be considered digital actuators
	- Since you have so few analog outputs, when you decide which pins to use
		for which device, reserve the analog output pins for analog output devices
		as much as possible

#### Discussion: How is this class going for you?

- Not true analog voltage. PWM = Pulse Width Modulation
- Works for LEDs and motors

#### Functions that you know from p5.js which are useful here:
- `map()`
- `constrain()`
- `if()`

Remember how we used `print()` in p5.js to help us find problems in our 
program? You can do that in Arduino to but the function has a slightly
different name: `Serial.println()`
- Must be initialized `Serial.begin()`
- Can not concatenate strings with the `+` function
	- Instead, you need multiple calls to `Serial.print()` e.g.:

````
Serial.print("First value = ");
Serial.print(firstValue);
Serial.print(" Second value = ");
Serial.print(secondValue);
Serial.println();
````

Here is the program we developed at the end of class:

````
const int LED_PIN = 3;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
const int POT_PIN = A2;
int brightness = 0;    // how bright the LED is

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // declare pin 9 to be an output:
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  int pot_value = analogRead(POT_PIN); // 0-1023
  brightness = map(pot_value, 0, 1023, 255, 0);
  Serial.println(brightness);
  analogWrite(LED_PIN, brightness); // 0-255
}
````

#### In-class exercise

1. Use one of the analogue sensors to select which of two LEDs lights up
1. Use one of the analogue sensor to control how fast two LEDs alternate
1. Use a momentary switch (often called a *pushbutton* or a *button* in the
	 Arduino literature) to select a different range for mapping an analog
	 sensor to an analog output device
1. Use a potentiometer to select from 4 different behaviors of a circuit
1. Use a momentary switch to enter a mode where the minimum and maximum values
	from the LDR are stored. When the switch is released, use those values to
	map the range of values from the LDR to the full range of the LED brightness

### Tuesday November 8, 2022

#### Announcement
Thursday I'm at a conference so our class will be held online via Zoom.
Attendance is still required.

#### Today
- Break at 2:10
- Sound
- Servo motor
- More about circuits
- In class exercises
- Examples

#### Sound

**`tone()`**

- [Schematic](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ToneMelody)
- Before you try that code, just try 
`tone(spkrPin, 440);`
and
`tone(spkrPin, 440, 1000);`
- [Reference
page](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/advanced-io/tone/)

**Notes**
- "Use of the `tone()` function will interfere with PWM output on pins 3 and 11"
	- The word "intefere" is rather vague. 
	I think they mean that it 
	prevents `analogWrite()` from working on pins 3 and 11
- The `tone()` function is *non-blocking*
- Arduino supports tabs 
- Arduino has arrays 
- What is resistor for? 
	- LED needs a resistor to limit current so it doesn't burn out
	- LDR needs a resistor to form a voltage divider
	- Piezo buzzer neither burns out nor needs a voltage divider
	- So why a resistor?

#### Servo motor

- [Schematic](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Knob)
- [Reference
page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo)


**Notes**
- Use of the servo library disables `analogWrite()` (PWM) on pins 9 and 10
- The `Servo.write()` function is *non-blocking*

#### More about PWM
- How do you suppose `analogWrite()` makes an LED dimmer?
- [PWM](https://www.ekwb.com/blog/what-is-pwm-and-how-does-it-work/)
- What do `analogWrite()`, `tone()` and `Servo` have in common?
- What is sound?
- How does a servo motor
	[work](https://lastminuteengineers.com/servo-motor-arduino-tutorial/)?

**Notes**
1. You may have noticed that the built-in LED blinks 3 times when you turn on
	 your Arduino. In fact it does this every time it resets, which also happens
	 when you upload a new program. Since this LED is connected directly to pin
	 13, it means that whatever you have attached to pin 13 will be activated 3
	 times briefly whenver the Arduino resets. So, if you make a big robot, 
	 you probably should not use pin 13 for the motor
1. Pins 0 and 1 are used for communication with your laptop, and this has two
	 effects:
	1. Connecting anything to pins 0 or 1 might interfere with laptop
		 communication (which includes uploading!)
	2. Anything connected to pins 0 or 1 might be activated during
		 communication!
1. For these reasons it is best to avoid pins 0, 1, and 13. If you run out of
	 pins and need to use them there are ways around this.

#### Data Types

Unlike in p5.js, you must declare what type of data you want to store in a
variable:

- `int` - whole numbers only
- `float` - a number with a fractional part ('floating point number')
- `char` - a character
- `boolean` - only either `true` or `false`

#### Conventions: Schematics and Wire Colours

- When drawing schematics

	- All **sensors** on the **left**
	- All **inputs** on the **left** side of the Arduino 
	- All **actuators** on the **right**
	- All **outputs** on the **right** side of the Arduino 
	- There are exceptions e.g.
		- If using CAD you can't control where the pins are on Arduino
		- Some devices (e.g. the ultrasonic distance measuring sensor) that have
			both inputs and outputs

- When wiring your circuits

	- All **5V** connections should use **red** wire, 
	and don't use red for anything else
	- All **GND** connections should use **black** wire,
	and don't use black for anything else
		- If you run out of black you may either
			- Color some white cables black with a Sharpie
			- Dedicate green as an additional black, and then
			don't use green for anything else either
	- All other connections can use any other colors
	- If you use the buses on the sides of the breadboard
		- Red bus for 5V only
		- Black or Blue bus for GND only

#### In-class exercises


1. Build a circuit with a switch (pushbutton) and a servo motor, and when you
	 press the switch go to one position, when you don't press the switch go to
	 another

2. Add a piezo buzzer so that when the switch is pressed it plays a tone for
	 half a second, then a tone for another half a second as long as the switch
	 is pressed

3. Modify the code so that it plays the two tones only once when the switch is
	 pressed

4. Add an LED and make the LED change brightness according to which tone is
	 playing

5. Add a potentiometer which controls how fast the servo motor moves from one
	 position to the next

#### Examples

Some examples using the piezo speaker, servo motor, and a potentiometer:

````
// Moving the servo motor first to one position and then to another,
// and then stopping:

const int servoPin = 7;

#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo;

void setup() {
	myservo.attach(servoPin);
	myservo.write(10);
	delay(1000);
	myservo.write(130);
}

void loop() { 
}
````

````
// Moving the servo motor first to one position and then to another,
// continuously:

const int servoPin = 7;

#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo;

void setup() {
	myservo.attach(servoPin);
}

void loop() {
	myservo.write(10);
	delay(1000);
	myservo.write(130);
	delay(1000);
}
````

````
// Minimal example of the tone() function
// Make a tone, never stop

const int spkrPin = 7;

void setup() {
	tone(spkrPin, 440); // starts a tone on pin 7 at frequency 440
}

void loop() {
 // Arduino always needs a loop, even if it's empty
}
````

Is the `tone()` function blocking? 

````
// If tone() is a blocking function, the LED will be off while the tone sounds
// If the LED comes on as soon as the tone starts, tone() is non-blocking
const int spkrPin = 7;

void setup() {
	pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);

	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
	tone(spkrPin, 440, 1500); // starts a tone and then automatically stops it after 1500 milliseconds
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
}

void loop() {
}
````

````
// Using a potentiometer to control the position of a servo motor

#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo

int potpin = A0;  // analog pin used to connect the potentiometer

void setup() {
	myservo.attach(9);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
	int val = analogRead(potpin); // reads the value of the potentiometer (value between 0 and 1023)
	val = map(val, 0, 1023, 0, 180); // scale it for use with the servo (value between 0 and 180)
	myservo.write(val);   // sets the servo position according to the scaled value
	delay(15);            // waits for the servo to get there
}
````

````
	// Use a potentiometer to control the position of a servo motor
	// and the pitch of a tone

	#include <Servo.h>
	Servo myservo;

	void setup() {
		// initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
		Serial.begin(9600);
		myservo.attach(7);
	}

	void loop() {
		// read the input on analog pin 0:
		int sensorValue = analogRead(A2);
		// print out the value you read:
		Serial.println(sensorValue);

		// servo motor stuff
		int servoPosition = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 180);
		myservo.write(servoPosition);

		// piezo buzzer stuff
  int pitch = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 200, 4000);
  tone(8, pitch);

  delay(1);        // delay in between reads for stability
}
````

### Thursday November 10, 2022

#### Discussion
Physical computing's Greatest Hits and Misses; Making Interactive Art: Nouf and Clara

#### Circuits

Some theory that might help you think about why circuits are they way they
are
- Important concepts:
	- Voltage 
		- Voltage is a relative quantity so it's always measured or identified
			relative to some other point (usually a common reference point such as
			"ground")
		- Can be thought of the "pressure" applied to the electrons
		- Analogous to holding a brick at a certain height above the floor. Relative
			to the floor, the brick has a certain amount of potential energy
		- Voltage exists whether or not there is a circuit
	- Resistance 
		- The resistance the electrons face as they try to get through
		components. 
		- Analogous to a traffic jam on a road
		- Conductors (wires) have zero resistance (for our purposes)
		- All components have some sort of "resistance"
		- Resistance is a property of a component and therefore
		exists whether or not there is a circuit
	- Current  
		- The rate of flow of electrons through a circuit (electrons/second)
		- Somewhat analogous to litres/hour or cars/hour
		- **Current only exists when there is a circuit**
- If you measure the voltage between any two points, the voltage will not
	change as you move to different places on the **wire**. 
		However if you cross
		a component the voltage might be different on the other side of the
		component
- If you measure current through components connected in 
	series the current will not change. This is because **all** the electrons
	that go through the first component have to go through the rest. No
	electrons can leave the path, and no new ones can enter.
		However if there are any branches some electrons might go on the
		branches and thus the current will drop.
- Review
- Voltage does **not** change in a conductor
	- That is why we can connect things to the same node in any order
- Voltage **does** change when you go across a component
	- That is why it is **important** to make connections to the correct side of a
		component!

#### Arduino-p5.js communication

Basics
- [p5 code](https://editor.p5js.org/mangtronix/sketches/vQzE2Yhpj)
- [Arduino code](https://github.com/mangtronix/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/Week_11_Serial_pot.ino)

Can you go both ways?
- https://editor.p5js.org/aaronsherwood/sketches/q2Pl77SWl

Briefly, what this code does:
- Arduino waits for a message from p5.
- Arduino expects two values separated by a comma. It uses these two values to
	control two LEDs.
- Arduino then reads two sensors and sends the values back to p5, separated by
	a comma.
- p5 reads these two values from Arduino. One value controls the text color,
	the other controls the text transparency
- p5 sends two values back to Arduino indicating if the mouse was clicked, and
	if so, which half of the screen it was in.

Once it's working, duplicate the code and then start adapting it to your needs:
- Duplicate Aaron's project so that you get the other files as well
- Increase or decrease the amount of data that is exchanged. You may need more, or you may need less.
- Modify the data that is exchanged. You may need a digital sensor on the Arduino instead of an analog sensor. Similarly, on the p5 side, you may need something different from a mouse click or changing the text color and transparency.
- Once you are reliable sending information back and forth you can start adding the rest of your program

In-class exercise (break class into groups of 2-3 students)
- make something that uses only one sensor on arduino and makes the ellipse in
	p5 move on the horizontal axis, in the middle of the screen, and nothing on
	arduino is controlled by p5
- make something that controls the LED brightness from p5
- take the [gravity wind
	example](https://editor.p5js.org/aaronsherwood/sketches/I7iQrNCul) and make
	it so every time the ball bounces one led lights up and then turns off, and
	you can control the wind from one analog sensor

- All kind of motors
	- AC motors
	- DC motors
	- Brushless DC motors
	- Stepper motors
	- Servo motors (which actually consist of a DC motor + servo circuitry)

##### In-class exercise

- Take the DC motor and connect it directly to 5V and GND
- Now reverse the wires

Can we connect the motor to an Arduino output just like we did with the piezo
buzzer?
- How would we reverse it?
- Another problem: Arduino current limitations

##### Arduino current limitations

- What is current? It is the rate of flow of electrons through a conductor.
	- You don't get to control the current. 
	- The voltage depends on the current and the resistance (Ohm's law: I=V/R)
	- You can provide a voltage (with Arduino, the voltage is always 5V)
	- Each device has it's own "resistance"

LEDs have relatively <strong>high</strong> "resistance", 
and so consume <strong>low</strong> current.
Motors have relatively <strong>low</strong> "resistance", 
and so consume <strong>high</strong> current

- Current flowing through any resistance causes heat (P = I^2/R)
- Everything has resistance

**Therefore, where electricity is flowing there will be heat**

**Heat causes damage**

(We've not had to worry about that up to now because everything we've done
uses very little current)

Arduino can not protect itself from damaged caused by overheating. 
It does not <strong>limit</strong> current, 
it is <strong>damaged</strong> by too much current

The amount of heat a component can withstand before it is damaged 
is governed, to a large extent, by its size

The transistors that make up Arduino are tiny

The reason for using the separate Motor Driver is simple:

**It has much bigger transistors**

(It also makes it easier to control both direction and speed, 
but you could do that with the Arduino alone, 
it  would just be more complicated)

In addition to the bigger transistors, the Motor Driver
includes an H-bridge which allows us to control rotation direction

How did I choose which pins to use?
- Never use pins 0 and 1 (dedicated for USB communication)
- Avoid pin 13 if possible (it flashes 3 times on reset)
- Directional control pins (ain1, ain2, bin1, bin2) only require
	digital signals so avoid pins with extra functionality 
	(analog input, SPI, PWM)
- Inclusion of the servo library 
	disables `analogWrite()` on pins 9 and 10
	(I'm not using the servo library now but perhaps I'll add it later)
- Use of the `tone()` function 
	disables `analogWrite()` on pins 3 and 11
	(I'm not using the `tone()` function now but perhaps I'll add it later)
- This leaves PWM pins 5 and 6 for the speed controls (pwma and pwmb)
- Might as well choose nearby digital pins

Code

````

const int ain1Pin = 3;
const int ain2Pin = 4;
const int pwmAPin = 5;

const int bin1Pin = 8;
const int bin2Pin = 7;
const int pwmBPin = 6;


void setup() {
  pinMode(ain1Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ain2Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(pwmAPin, OUTPUT); // not needed really
}

void loop() {
  // turn in one direction, full speed
  Serial.println("full speed");
  analogWrite(pwmAPin, 255);
  digitalWrite(ain1Pin, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(ain2Pin, LOW);
  // stay here for a second
  delay(1000);

  // slow down
  Serial.println("slowing down");
  int speed = 255;
  while (speed--) {
    analogWrite(pwmAPin, speed);
    delay(20);
  }
}

Control the motor speed and direction using a potentiometer:

````
const int ain1Pin = 3;
const int ain2Pin = 4;
const int pwmAPin = 5;

const int bin1Pin = 8;
const int bin2Pin = 7;
const int pwmBPin = 6;

const int potPin = A5;


void setup() {
  pinMode(ain1Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ain2Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(pwmAPin, OUTPUT); // not needed really
}

void loop() {
  int potVal = analogRead(potPin);
  delay(20);
  if (potVal > 1023 / 2) { //counterclockwise
    digitalWrite(ain1Pin, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ain2Pin, LOW);
    analogWrite(pwmAPin, potVal / 4);
  } else { //clockwise
    digitalWrite(ain1Pin, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ain2Pin, HIGH);
    analogWrite(pwmAPin, 255 - potVal / 4);
  }
}

##### Debugging

If you want my help solving a problem in your assignment, do the following:
1. Figure out the simplest circuit and program that demonstrates your problem
1. Upload your schematic, code, and 
the best picture you can take of your breadboard circuit to Github 
1. Write a message on Discord, describing carefully
	1. What you think should happen
	1. What you observe happens

What techniques have you learned to help you find problems?

##### Blink Without `delay()`

Why do we need this? 
- To get rid of `delay()`

What problem does `delay()` cause? 
- **`delay()` is a blocking function. 
Whenever your program encounters `delay()`, 
your program stops until the delay is finished**

For example, how would you
- Blink LEDs at different rates
- Blink an LED while playing a tune
- Play a tune while moving a servo motor
- Do anything while responding to sensors immediately


[Tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BlinkWithoutDelay)

So much for blinking. What if we want to move a servo motor at the same time?
