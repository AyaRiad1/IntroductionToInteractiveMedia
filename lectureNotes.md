**Processing**

#### Simple shapes

- `ellipse()`
- `rect()`
- `size()`
- `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
- `line()`
- `point()`

What does this all mean?
- Functions
- Arguments or parameters

Controlling color, fill, and stroke

- `color()`
- `stroke()`
- `noStroke()`
- `fill()`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 180)`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, PI, CHORD)`

Here is the program we developed in class:

````
size( 400, 1000);

//rect(60,60, 100, 150);
//circle(50, 50, 60);
//ellipse( 100, 120, 100, 35);

line(200, 300, 200, 400);
line(230, 300, 230, 400);

point(50, 50);

// this will draw the body (I think)
fill(200, 100, 30);
circle(215, 270, 80);

noStroke();

// this muse be the head
 fill(0, 10, 255);
 circle(215, 200, 40);
 
 stroke(0, 100, 20);
 line(200, 200, 250, 200);
 
 arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, radians(130));
````

### September 2 2021

#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- Questions from Tuesday?
- Where to get help
	- Google
	- Processing reference page
	- Discord

#### Variables

- `int myNumber = 45;`
- `int myRandomNumber = random(255);`
- `int myRandomNumber = round(random(255));`
How do we know what a variable's value is?
`print()` and `println()`

- There are many other variable types. 
`int` is by far most common, `float` being a close second
- Built-in variables
	- `width`, `height`, `mouseX`, `mouseY`
	- many others; we will discover more as we go along

#### Animation
- `draw()`
- `setup()`

````
int foo = 0;

void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
}

void draw() {
  ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  foo = foo + 1;
}
````

`background()`

Here are the two programs I developed in class:

````
// This program is in Static mode

size(100, 700);

// use the built-in variables width and height to calculate the circle center
circle(width/2, height/3, 100);


//int triangleTopLeftX;
//triangleTopLeftX = 50;

int triangleTopLeftX = 250;
int redValue;
redValue = round( random(256) ); // returns a random number up to but not including 256
fill(redValue, 10, 30);
triangle(triangleTopLeftX, 20,  // top left corner
         triangleTopLeftX+100, 30, // top right corner
         triangleTopLeftX+50, 200); // bottom corner

// use mouseX and mouseY to draw a small circle
circle (mouseX, mouseY, 30);
````

(In class I said this was Dynamic mode but I was wrong; it's called *active
mode*:)

````
// Active mode
void setup() {
  size(500, 500);
}

int triangleTopLeftX = 0;
int redValue = 255;
void draw() {
  // erase the trail of circle
  background(10, 255, 255);

  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 30);
  println("mouse coordinates = " + mouseX + ", " + mouseY);

  if (triangleTopLeftX >= width)
  {
    triangleTopLeftX = 0;
  }
  triangleTopLeftX += 1;

  if (redValue == 155)
    redValue = 255;
  redValue -= 1;
  fill(redValue, redValue-100, redValue-100);
  triangle(triangleTopLeftX, 20, // top left corner
    triangleTopLeftX+100, 30, // top right corner
    triangleTopLeftX+50, 200); // bottom corner
}
````

Here is the program that one of the students (I didn't catch who this was)
developed to change the color smoothly as the triangle moved 
across the canvas. I will discuss this next week:
````
// Dynamic mode

void setup() {
  size (500, 500);
}

int triangleTopLeftX = 0;

void draw() {

  background(10, 255, 255);

  // use mouseX and mouseY to draw a small circle
  fill(0);
  circle (mouseX, mouseY, 30);
  println("mouse coordinates = " + mouseX +"," + mouseY);

  {

    triangleTopLeftX = triangleTopLeftX + 1; // trying to get it to move
    if (triangleTopLeftX >= width) {
      triangleTopLeftX = 0;
    }

    int redValue;
    redValue = round( random(256) ); // returns a random number up to but not including 256
    fill(redValue, 10, 30);
    triangle(triangleTopLeftX, 20, // top left corner
      triangleTopLeftX+100, 30, // top right corner
      triangleTopLeftX+50, 200); // bottom corner
  }
}
````

### September 7 2021

#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- Questions from Thursday?

#### Review: 

- Static vs. active mode
- Variables
- Built-in variables
- Variables declared outside of `draw()` or `setup()` can be changed later
- `println()`

````
// Example usage of a global variable

int count; // this is now a global variable

void setup() {
  circle(50, 50, 30);
  count = 7; // the variable is initialized here
}

void draw() {
  count = count + 1; // not algebra!
  // The result of the right hand side calculation
  // replaces whatever value was stored in the variable
  // on the left side of the '=' sign
  // end result: the variable "count" is incremented by 1

  println (count);
}
````

`frameRate()`

````
void setup() {
  println(frameRate);  // frameRate is a built-in variable
  frameRate(10);       // frameRate() is a function
  println(frameRate); // it takes awhile for the frame rate to change
}

void draw() {
  println(frameRate);
}
````

#### Interaction with Processing

- conditionals

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
}

void draw() {
  if (mousePressed == true) {
    background(color(0, 0, 255));
  } else {
    background(color(200, 0, 0));
  }
}
````

You can also use the `mousePressed()` function. Note that there is a huge
difference between the `mousePressed` variable and the `mousePressed()` 
function: the variable `mousePressed` is true as long as any mouse button 
is pressed, while the function `mousePressed()` is called only once whenever 
a mouse button is pressed, no matter how long it's pressed for:

````
int pressCount = 0;
int mouseClickCount = 0;
boolean mouseWasPressed = false;

void setup() {
  frameRate(2.5); // slow down so can see blue background
}

void draw(){
  if (mouseWasPressed) {
    background(color(0, 0, 255));
    mouseWasPressed = false;
  } else {
    background(color(200, 0, 5));
  }
  println(mouseClickCount);
}

void mousePressed() {
    mouseWasPressed = true;
    mouseClickCount = mouseClickCount + 1;
}
````

**Important concepts**:
1. `mousePressed` is another built-in variable. There are many others.
1. `mousePressed` is a new type of data, namely a `boolean`, which means it has
	 only one of two values, `true` or `false`
1. Note that `{` and `}` indicate the blocks
1. The `else` part of an `if()` statement is optional (what happens if we
	 remove it?)

- Two more interesting built-in variables: `mouseX`, `mouseY`
	- Using the cursor to draw
	- Now use a mouse press to clear the screen
	- Note the difference between a press, click, and release
	- (Time permitting, primitive painting program)

#### Loops
`while()` is like `if()` but it keeps on doing it as long as condition is true

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);

  int foo = 50; // create and initialize a variable

  while (foo < width) { // keep going as long as the condition is true
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
		// modify the variable so something different happens next time
    foo = foo + 50; 
  }
}
````

1. You should get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your variables.
	1. What is a better name for the variable foo?
1. What would happen if you replace the `while()` with `if()`?

There is another way to make a loop using the keyword `for()`. The `for()`
loop structure combines the initialization step and the incrementation step
into the `for()` loop construction:

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (int foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  }
}
````

Which should you use? Whichever is easier for you to understand. Remember that
**most of the time spent programming is fixing problems**, and **whatever you
understand best will probably have fewer problems**.

Here is the debugging we did at the end of class. As I explained, the
`print()` and `println()` functions are great ways to find out what your
program is doing. Sometimes figuring out what to print, and the best way
to print it to see the problem, is a bit of an artform that improves with
time:

````
//How to use the '+' sign to create a string suitable for printing from a variety
//of string literals and variables

void setup() {
  size(700, 700);
  int yPos = 0;
  int xPos = 0;
  for (yPos = 30; yPos < height-30; yPos=yPos + 40) {
    for (xPos = 20; xPos<width-60; xPos=xPos + 40) {

      line(xPos, yPos, yPos, yPos); // this draws horizontal lines, many on top of each other
      // line(xPos, yPos, xPos, xPos); // this draws vertical lines, many on top of each other
      println("line from (" + xPos + "," + yPos + ") to ("  + yPos + "," + yPos + ")");
      // rect(xPos, yPos, 40, 40); // This effectively draws the grid
    }
  }
}
````

#### Functions

Every time you use one of the built-in 'commands', you are really using (or
more properly 'calling') a built-in function. Functions are a very important
building block of programming, and in addition to using built-in functions,
you can also create your own. In fact, you've already been doing that, when
you created the `setup()` and `draw()` functions. In the case of
`setup()` and `draw()` you have to use those names, but when you create other
functions you can make up your own names. Just like variables names, good 
function names make your programs easier to understand.

Why create your own functions?

- Reuse (if it's something you might do again)
- Clarity (remember your three important audiences: yourself, others learning
	from you, me when I grade your work)
- Easier to debug (what is debugging?)
	- One of the most powerful ways to approach
	a bug is to reproduce it with simplest possible example. 
	This is much easier when the thing that's causing
	the problem is already a function.
- Modularity
- Flexibility (with good choice of parameters)

Let's modify the example from last class to use a function. First let's draw a
house instead of a circle to make it a little more interesting:

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (int foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    rect(foo, 50, 40, 40);
    line(foo, 50, foo+20, 30);
    line(foo+20, 30, foo+40, 50);
  }
}
````

Now let's make a function called `drawOneHouse()`. If we want to
draw a house at different locations, we need a way to tell
the function `drawOneHouse()` where to put the house. Functions accommodate
this by allowing us to pass information into the function by putting 
that information in the parenthesis. In the function, we store this
information in temporary variables that we can use in the function:

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);

  for (int foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50) {
    drawOneHouseAt(foo);
  }
}

void drawOneHouseAt(int x) {
  rect(x, 50, 40, 40);
  line(x, 50, x+20, 30);
  line(x+20, 30, x+40, 50);
}
````

**Things to notice**
1. I've said this before and I'll keep saying: 
	**Choose descriptive names for your variables and functions!** 
	`foo` is a bad name, `xPos` is a good name,
	 `houseXPos` is a better name.
1. The value of `foo` (50, 100, 150 ...) is the information passed to the
	 function so that the function can do it's work. The proper name for this
	 information is an **argument**
1. The variable `x` is a temporary variable that **only exists in the function**.
	 This variable is used to store the argument that was passed into the
	 function so that the function can do its work. Once the function is
	 finished, this variable is no longer needed and is destroyed. 
	 A variable used in this way is called a **parameter**
1. Functions may take zero, one, or multiple arguments. When you write 
	a function, you decide how many arguments you need. For example, we might
	have included the house size or roof height or house y location. (Of course
	when you use functions that someone else wrote 
	you must use the proper number of parameters.)
1. Functions can return information as well, for example the `random()`
	 function. Functions can either return one piece of information, or none.
	We will see later how to do this. If your function returns no information,
	use the word `void` in front of the function name to indicate this.
1. Finally we understand why `setup()` and `draw()` have the world `void` in
	 front of them! They are functions that return no information, just like
	 our function `drawOneHouseAt()`

#### Variable Scope

````
int foo;  // this is a global variable, visible in all functions

void setup() {
  foo = 7;
}

void draw() {

  println(foo);

  int bar; // this is a local variable, visible only inside of draw()

  for (int i = 0; i < width/2; i++) { 
    // i is a local variable visible only inside this for() loop
    ellipse(i, height/2, 10,15);
  }
}
````

### September 14 2021

#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- Questions from last week?
- Review: The `draw()` function

In class exercise:

1. Write a function that will take a single parameter
and draw a vertical line from the top of the canvas to the bottom
at the X coordinate indicated by the parameter
	1. In the `setup()` function test your function 
	at a couple of different locations
1. Write another function that will draw a **horizontal** line
at the indicated **Y** coordinate
	1. Test as before
1. Using these two functions, write a program in `setup()`
that draws a grid of lines at regular intervals on the canvas

Discussion:

- What debugging methods helped you find and fix problems?
- What other functions might be useful?
- What other parameters might be useful?

#### Motion

Let us use make a ball bounce on the floor. First, make a circle move:

<pre>void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
  x = width/2;
} 

float speed = 5;
float x;
float y = 0;

void draw() {
  background(150);

  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;
}
</pre>

Now, make it change directions when it hits the floor:

<pre>void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
  x = width/2;
} 

float speed = 5;
float x;
float y = 0;

void draw() {
  background(150);

  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;

  if (y>=height) {
    speed = -speed;
  }
}
</pre>

Now, do two thing: 1) use gravity to increase its speed as it falls and 2) reduce its speed on each bounce:

<pre>

float gravity = .1;
float speed = 0;
float x = 320;
float y = 0;

void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
} 

void draw() {
  background(150);
  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;

  speed+=gravity;

  if (y>=height) {
    speed = 0.95 * speed; // this slows the acceleration
    speed = -speed; // this reverses
  }
}
</pre>

Discussion:

- What functions might be useful here?
- How can we use the `random()` function to make things more interesting?
- What about multiple bouncing balls?
- How could I make the ball move sideways?
- How could I make it bounce off the walls as well?

#### Arrays 

````
final int numberOfValues = 10;

int[] values = new int[numberOfValues];

int n = 0;
while (n < values.length) {
  values[n] = (n+1) * (n+1);
  n = n + 1;
}

for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
  println(values[i]);
}
````

**Things to notice**

- Similar to the way functions are signified by `()`, 
	arrays are signified by `[]`
- Arrays can be of any data type, but can't be mixed types
- Two new concepts:
	- `final` keyword
	- `new` keyword
- Why not just use ten "normal" variables?
- Arrays and loops (either `for()` or `while()`) almost always show up
  together. If you have an array, you almost always want a loop.
- Note that the `while()` loop used to put the numbers into the array
	is exactly the same as the `for()` loop used to print the array. I could
	have used either in both places. I did this to show you that they are
	interchangeable.

#### How to add more examples into Processing

For example, from Dan Shiffman's book *Learning Processing*

1. File -> Examples -> Add Examples
1. type `learning processing` in the search box
1. select the one we want

Now you can see all examples from Dan's excellent book 

1. File -> Examples -> Contributed Examples

The examples are also online [here](http://learningprocessing.com/examples)

You will find many interesting examples in there, including many on arrays.

A more advanced array example, and introduction to the very useful `map()`
function:

````
float[] coswave; 

void setup() {
  size(900, 300);
  
  coswave = new float[width];
  for (int xPosition = 0; xPosition < width; xPosition++) {
    coswave[xPosition] = cos(radians(xPosition));
  }
  background(255);
  noLoop();
}

void draw() {
  for (int xPosition = 0; xPosition < width; xPosition++) {
    float waveHeight = map(coswave[xPosition], -1, 1, 0, height);
    point(xPosition, waveHeight);
  }
}
````

**Remember**
- Arrays and loops (either `for()` or `while()`) almost always show up
  together. If you use an array, you probably want a loop.
- Just like single variables and functions, 
	**choose good names for your arrays!**

**Things to notice**
* In the first array example, 
I created the variable that would store the
array, and created the ten `int`s, all in one line. 
In this cosine example,
I created the variable that would store the array globally, 
and then I created the `float` variables inside of `setup()`.
Either way works; sometimes you will find you have to do it one
way or the other, but for the most part it's your choice.
* I used `noLoop()` because this only needed to run once. In fact
I didn't even need to use `draw()`, 
I could have put all the action into `setup()`. I did it this way so that I
could introduce you to the `noLoop()` function
* How did I get the height of the wave to perfectly fit the height?
Practice using the `map()` function, it is incredibly useful
and works in Arduino also exactly the same way.

#### Transformations
Transformationss move the canvas relative to the coordinate sysem
so you can draw in different places with the same code
- Available 2D transforms are 
	- `translate()`
	- `rotate()`
	- `scale()`
- pushMatrix() and popMatrix() allow you to remember where the canvas was, 
and then return to it's last position

Example: Draw a house at a given location, no transform:

````
void house(int x, int y)
{
  triangle(x + 15, y, x, y + 15, x + 30, y + 15);
  rect(x, y + 15, 30, 30);
  rect(x + 12, y + 30, 10, 15);
}
````

Same result, but using a transform:

````
void house(int x, int y)
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(x, y);
  triangle(15, 0, 0, 15, 30, 15);
  rect(0, 15, 30, 30);
  rect(12, 30, 10, 15);
  popMatrix();
}
````

##### Rotation and scaling 

Work through 
<a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/transform2d/">this</a> 
tutorial

* As always, Dan Shiffman has excellent
[examples](http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp14/example-14-02-multiple-translation).

#### Text

````
String message= "Important message";

void setup() {
  size(640, 360);

  // What fonts are available?
  // String[] fontList = PFont.list();
  // printArray(fontList);

  PFont f = createFont("monaco", 32);
  textFont(f, 32);

	color myFavoriteColor =color(255, 0, 0);
  fill(myFavoriteColor);

  textAlign(CENTER);
  text(message, width/2, height/2);
}
````

**Things to notice**

* New datatype called `PFont`
* New datatype called `color`
* `fill()` and `textAlign()` will apply to any further texts or shapes until
they are changed

Some advanced examples using text are

##### Data Visualization

What is data visualization? Here are some examples:

- [Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/allstreets/)
- [Aaron Koblin](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/project/flight-patterns)
- [Jer Thorp](https://www.jerthorp.com/portfolio) e.g. Just Landed

###### Finding data

Sources

- https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/rt_data_access.shtml
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
 	
Format

- The most common format is CSV, especially as you can use any spreadsheet
	(Excel, OpenOffice Calc, Google Sheets) to export any table in CSV format
- Other formats are JSON and XML. We won't spend much time on them, but there
	are Processing libraries available for parsing them

### September 23 2021

#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- Discussion: The Art of Interactive Design (Shumin and Boby) (20 minutes max)

##### Worked example: Getting and working with a CSV file

- A [database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/) of energy generated by wind turbines
- Click "Get Data"
- Scroll down a bit to "Tabular Data: CSV format" and click on "CSV
format". 
	- This will download a `.zip` file.
- Unzip the file. 
	- This will create `uswtdb_v4_1_20210721.csv`
- This is a plain text file; you can view it with a text editor
	- You will see that the first line is the heading of each column
	- Some of the fields are numerical (e.g. case_id)
	- Some of the fields are text (e.g. t_state, t_county)
	- Some of the fields are missing (e.g. faa_ors, faa_asn)
- Now you can load this file into an array of `Strings` and then process each
	line one at a time, pulling out individual fields. All this is done in the  
[example](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/tree/master/src/processingSketches/visualizeWindTurbineData)
we looked at in class


Things to notice:
1. The `split()` function does half the magic
1. The `int()` or `float()` function does much of the rest
1. data files might have errors in them and you need to defend your program
	 against them
1. `loop()` and `noLoop()` can be used anytime you want to start or stop the
	 `draw()` function from repeating



More complex examples are in Aaron Sherwood’s Introduction to Interactive Media <a href="https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media">Github repository</a>
<ul>
 	<li>load/split strings: splitCommas.pde</li>
 	<li>load save table: tableSaveLoad.pde</li>
 	<li>forces: lettersGravityWind.pde</li>
</ul>

##### JSON and XML: Other file formats

JSON and XML are other format for organizing data in a file. 
They are more complex than CSV, and again Processing provides functions.

For example for 
parsing [JSON](https://processing.org/examples/loadsavejson.html)

If you want to learn more about JSON and also XML, 
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqROpUNb2aY)
is a good introductory video tutorial.

##### Generative Text
Pull words from a CSV file 
and by using `random()` in a clever way,
write poems or slogans or whatever. 

Here is a terribly lame example:

````
/*
Generate poetry from a file of words
 the file has words in this format:
 
 roses,red,violets,blue,dream,disneyland
 
 we will refer to them as:
 
 item1,color1,item2,color2,verb,location
 
 and construct a poem:
 
 item1 are color1, item2 are color2
 when I verb I verb to location
 */

// Let's put the index of the word into numbers:
final int ITEM1 = 0;
final int COLOR1 = 1;
final int ITEM2 = 2;
final int COLOR2 = 3;
final int VERB = 4;
final int LOCATION = 5;
// final means that I will not change these variables
// It is conventional to use all caps for variable names that will not change


String strings[];

void setup() {

  // The text from the file is loaded into an array.
  strings = loadStrings("mydatafolder/words.csv");

  // How many lines did we get?
 // println("strings array contains this many lines: " + strings.length);
}

int csvRowNumber = 0;

void draw() {
  String singleRow[];

  // First line: "item1 are color1, item2 are color2"

  // Pick a random number, round that number DOWN to a whole number,
  // and split that row into individual words
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get item1
  print(singleRow[ITEM1]);

  print(" are " );

  // Now keep doing this for each word
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get color1
  print(singleRow[COLOR1]);
  
  // need a space between COLOR1 and ITEM2
  print(", " );

  // Now the second half of the first line: "violets are blue" 
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  print(singleRow[ITEM2]);
  print(" are " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get color1
  print(singleRow[COLOR2]);


  // that's the end of the first line of the poem so start a new line
  println();

  // Now the second line: when I verb I verb of location

  print("When I " );  
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  print(singleRow[VERB]);
  print(" I " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  print(singleRow[VERB]);
  print(" to the " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  print(singleRow[LOCATION]);

  // that's the end of the second line of the poem so start a new line
  // and also put an extra blank line
  println();
  println();

  noLoop(); // Wait for a mouse click then do it again
}

// If you click the mouse, allow the draw() function to resume
void mouseClicked() {
  loop();
}
````

and this is an example of the words you can feed it. If you copy the program
exactly as I have, you should make a folder called `mydatafolder` in the same
folder as the sketch, and then put these contents into a file called
`words.csv`:

````
roses,red,violets,blue,dream,disneyland
robots,silver,pencils,grey,run,supermarket
goldfish,orange,motors,white,turn,workbench
books,multicolored,lamposts,azure,swim,island
computers,black,mice,pink,squeak,home
````

#### Perlin Noise

````
void draw() {
  background(204);
  float n = random(0, width);
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
````

What if we wanted the line to move in a more organic, lifelike
fashion? Organic things (e.g. butterflys, leaves blowing in the wind, clouds) 
don't jump instantly from one place to another,
they tend to move close to where they were last time

````
float offset = 0.0;

void draw() {
  background(204);
  offset = offset + .01;
  float n = noise(offset) * width;
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
````

Things to notice:

* Why is the variable `offset` global? (Remember our discussion of variable
	scope)

#### Events

````
final int maxColors = 10;
color[] myColors = new color[maxColors];

int colorChoice = 0;

void setup() {
  size(600, 500);

  for (int i = 0; i < myColors.length; i ++ ) {
    myColors[i]=color(random(255), random(255), random(255));
  }
}

void draw() {
}

void mousePressed() {
  background(myColors[colorChoice]);
  colorChoice ++;
}
````

Things to notice:

* How does the background change if I never call `mousePressed()`?
`mousePressed()` is a *callback function*, meaning we have told
Processing that we are interested in this event, and if it occurs,
call this function. There are many different types of events available in
Processing, and you register an interest in them by creating a callback
function with the appropriate name. See *mouse* and *keyboard* 
in the Processing Reference Page.

* What happens if I click the mouse more than 10 times?  

##### Array Lists

Arrays are great, but they are of fixed size. There is an extension of the
array concept called an ArrayList which allows the size to be manipulated
dynamically.

Here is a short example showing how to work with ArrayLists:

````
class Thing {
  int i;
  float f;
  
  Thing(int _i, float _f) {
    i = _i;
    f = _f;
  }
  
  int getInt() {
    return i;
  }
  
  float getFloat() {
    return f;
  }
}

ArrayList<Thing> myThings = new ArrayList<Thing>();

void setup() {

  // The ArrayList should be empty
  println(myThings.size());

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    myThings.add(new Thing(i, float(i)));
    println(myThings.size()); // not that size() is a function!
  }

  // The value at index 5 should be 5
  // Just like arrays, the index starts at zero
  // so index 5 is the sixth item
  println("at index 5, x = " + myThings.get(5).getInt());
}

void mouseClicked() {
  myThings.add(new Thing(mouseX, mouseY));
  println("added a new Thing at mouse location x = " + mouseX + " y = " + mouseY);
}

void keyPressed() {
  if (key == 'd') {
    myThings.remove(0); // remove the first vector
    println("removed the first Thing, size is now " + myThings.size());
  }

  if (key == 'p') {
    for (int i = 0; i < myThings.size(); i++) {
      Thing t = myThings.get(i);
      println("index = " + i + " int = " + t.getInt() + " y = " + t.getFloat());
    }
  }
}

// Need to have a draw() function so that callbacks occur
void draw() {
}
````

#### Working with Images

To work along with me, either prepare an image file that you can work with or
download
[this](media/aiweiwei.jpeg)
image

<strong>PImage</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Just another class, i.e. it has
<ul>
 	<li>Data (the pixels, width, height, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Functionality `(image()`, `get()`, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

````
PImage photo; 

void setup() { 
  size(700, 700); 
  photo = loadImage("/home/michael/tmp/intro/aiweiwei.jpeg");
} 

void draw() { 
  image(photo, 10, 10);
	// How do you suppose you might scale the image?
}
````

Things to notice

* Get familiar with the error *NullPointerException*
* If you do not specify a complete path Processing will look 
in the same folder as the sketch and
for a folder called *data* in the same folder as the sketch
(I'm not sure in what order)


- `image(photo, positionX, positionY, width, height)` - display 
this image at this location and scale to this size
- `photo.resize(w,h)` - scale to this size. If one of the arguments is zero,
	then scale to the remaining argument and retain the original aspect ratio.
- `photo.get(x,y,w,h)` - Gets a portion of the image
- `photo.get(x,y)` - Gets the color of the pixel at this location

````
PImage photo;

void setup() {
  photo = loadImage("/home/michael/tmp/intro/aiweiwei.jpeg");

  size(700, 700);

  image(photo, 10, 10);

  PImage newImage = photo.get(400, 550, 100, 100);

  image (newImage, 50, 50);
}

Arrays of images

Example15-3: *Swappingimages* from Dan Shiffman's *Learning Processing* 


<strong>Pixels</strong>

You can access individual pixels 
from the canvas (and whatever is on the canvas)
using the special built-in array called `pixels`. 
Before using this array you must load images from the canvas 
into the `pixels` array using the `loadPixels()` function, 
and after making any changes you must call `updatePixels()` 
to write from the `pixels` array back to the canvas
if you want to make changes to the canvas

````
color pink = color(255, 102, 204);

loadPixels();

// change the first row to pink
for (int i = 0; i < width; i++) {
  pixels[i] = pink; 
}

updatePixels();
````

the pixels array is one-dimensional, 
meaning if you want to go to a different row on the canvas 
you need to offset by that many widths:

![](media/pixelarray2d.jpg)


````
color pink = color(255, 102, 204);

loadPixels();

// Change the fifth row to pink
for (int i = width*5; i < (width + width*5); i++) {
  pixels[i] = pink;
}

updatePixels();
````

It's important to remember that a pixel is just a color (red, green, blue).
Anything so you can manipulate pixels mathematically 
e.g. make it fade:

````
int r = 255;
int change = -1;
void setup() {
  size(500,500);
}

void draw() {

  color myColor = color(r, 102, 204);

  loadPixels();
  for (int i = 0; i < width * height; i++) {
    pixels[i] = myColor;
  }
  updatePixels();

  r -= change;

  if (r < 0 || r > 255) {
    change = -change;
  }
}

````

The `pixels` [data
type](https://processing.org/reference/color_datatype.html)

Some fun examples from Professor Sherwood:

![](media/circularImages.png)

````
PImage img;
PImage[] tiles;

int tileSize = 100;

void setup() {
  size (400,400);
  img = loadImage("/home/michael/tmp/intro/aiweiwei.jpeg");
  tiles = new PImage[img.height/tileSize];
  for (int i=0; i< tiles.length; i++) {
    tiles[i] = img.get(int(random(img.width-tileSize)), int(random(img.height-tileSize)), tileSize, tileSize);
  }
  imageMode(CENTER);
}

void draw() {
  pushMatrix();
  translate(width/2, height/2);

  int numSegments = 10;
  float eachAngle = TWO_PI/numSegments;
  int whichImage = (int)random(tiles.length);
  for (int i = 0; i< numSegments; i++) {
    float x = cos(eachAngle*i)*tileSize+1;
    float y = sin(eachAngle*i)*tileSize+1;
    pushMatrix();
    translate(x, y);
    rotate(eachAngle*i);
    image(tiles[whichImage], 0, 0);
    popMatrix();
  }

  popMatrix();
  noLoop();
}

void keyPressed() {
  loop();
}
````

Here is a more complex version, on which I based the simple version above: [circularImages.pde](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/master/processingExamples/pixels/circularImages/circularImages.pde)

Can we use a sequence of images for animation?
