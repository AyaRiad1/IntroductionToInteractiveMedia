### Tuesday August 30, 2022
- Reminder that masks are required at all times indoors except when actively
  eating

#### Introduction to class
* Join Discord
* What are some examples of IM projects? 
	Spend a few minutes Googling 
	and put links in Discord
* What is IM?
	- Discussion
	- Read *What I hope for you* from
		Red Burns’ (founder of NYU's ITP) [Opening Remarks to New Students](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/focus-on-people-not-tech-and-other-impt-lessons-for-interaction-design-and-life/)
* Homework, projects, and grading
	- Most of you come into this class with different 
		backgrounds, skills, and knowledge, so 
		in IM, we grade by effort and progress, 
		not by a fixed level of accomplishment.
		- Challenge: How do I evaluate evaluate effort and progress? 
			- Ideas?
	- In IM we strongly encourage experimentation, thinking outside the box,
		and risk taking. 
		However taking risks is only possible 
		if failure doesn't have catastrophic results. 
		If failure results in a poor grade, 
		how does that encourage risk taking?
		- Suggestions?

* introductions

- Syllabus etc.
- **Connect to Zoom 10 minutes early**
	- This is to make sure you have time to fix any potential Zoom issues
	- You may keep your camera and mic turned off until class time

#### Let's get started

##### Simple shapes in p5.js

Open [p5.js editor](editor.p5.js/)

- `ellipse()`
- `rect()`
- `createCanvas()`
- `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
- `line()`
- `point()`

What does this all mean?
- Functions
- Arguments or parameters

Controlling color, fill, and stroke

- `stroke()`
- `noStroke()`
- `fill()`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 180)`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, radians(180), CHORD)`

[Here](https://editor.p5js.org/michaelshiloh/sketches/HYnL3E91x)
is the mouse location helper program I showed you at the end of class.

### Thursday September 1, 2022

##### More about programming

- Built-in variables
	- `mouseX`, `mouseY`
	- `width`, `height`
	- many others; we will discover more as we go along

##### Variables

- Javascript is not a typed language: you don't need to declare
	a variable's type
- `let myNumber = 4.5;`
- `let myString = "the quick brown fox";`
- `let myArray = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"];`
- `let myRandomNumber = random(255);`
- `let myRandomNumber = round(random(255));`
How can we find out what a variable's value is?
`print()` 

##### Animation

Use the `draw()` function to draw something different in each frame. This can
be the location of a shape but you can manipulate anything such as color also:

The  `draw()` function is called once per frame. Think of it as drawing a new
page on a ["flip book"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_book)

````
let foo = 0;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  foo = foo + 1;
}
````

By default, the previous frame is not erased. Sometimes this is useful.
Use the `background()` function to "paint" over any previous drawings. 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 500);
}

let triangleTopLeftX = 0;
let redValue = 255;

function draw() {
  // erase previous drawings
  background(10, 255, 255);

  // Move the triangle
  triangleTopLeftX = triangleTopLeftX + 1;

	// If the triangle reaches the right edge, move to the left edge
  if (triangleTopLeftX >= width) {
    triangleTopLeftX = 0;
  }

  // Change the value of red
  redValue = redValue - 1;

	//If red reaches a certian level, reset it
  if (redValue === 55) {
		redValue = 255;
	}

  // Select the fill for the triangle
  fill(redValue, redValue - 100, redValue - 100);

  // Draw the triangle
  triangle(
    triangleTopLeftX,
    20, // top left corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 100,
    30, // top right corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 50,
    200
  ); // bottom corner
  
  // Select the fill for the circle
  fill(10,20, 240);

  // Draw the circle
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 30);
  print("mouse coordinates = " + mouseX + ", " + mouseY);
}

````

##### Notes:

- Local vs. Global variables
- Built-in variables

````
// Example usage of a global variable

let count; // this is now a global variable

function setup() {
  circle(50, 50, 30);
  count = 7; // the variable is initialized here
}

function draw() {
  count = count + 1; // not algebra!
  // The result of the right hand side calculation
  // replaces whatever value was stored in the variable
  // on the left side of the '=' sign
  // end result: the variable "count" is incremented by 1

  print (count);
}
````
### Tuesday September 6, 2022

##### Any questions? Review last week if necessary

##### What is `frameRate()`?

````
function setup() {
  frameRate(10);       // frameRate() is a function
  print(frameRate()); // it takes awhile for the frame rate to change
}

function draw() {
  print(frameRate());
}
````

- conditionals 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed === true) {
    background(color(0, 0, 255));
  } else {
    background(color(200, 0, 0));
  }
}
````

**Notes**:
1. `mouseIsPressed` is another built-in variable. There are many others.
1. `mouseIsPressed` is a new type of data, namely a `boolean`, 
	which means it has
	 only one of two values, `true` or `false`
1. Note that `{` and `}` indicate the blocks
1. The `else` part of an `if()` statement is optional (what happens if we
	 remove it?)

In class exercise:
- Using the cursor to draw
- Now use a mouse press to clear the screen
- Clear the screen if the mouse is pressed inside a certain circle
- Combine these to create a primitive painting program

### Thursday September 8, 2022

##### Loops
- `while()` is like `if()` but it keeps on doing it as long as condition is true
	- Whereas `if()` does it only once
	- The assumption is that something changes while you're doing the loop which
		might eventually make the condition false, otherwise you'd be stuck there
		forever
- `for()` is a variation in structure but basically does the same

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  let foo = 50; // create and initialize a variable

  while (foo < width) { // keep going as long as the condition is true
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
		// modify the variable so something different happens next time
    foo = foo + 50; 
  }
}
````

1. You should get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your variables.
	1. What is a better name for the variable foo?
1. What would happen if you replace the `while()` with `if()`?

There is another way to make a loop using the keyword `for()`. The `for()`
loop structure combines the initialization step and the incrementation step
into the `for()` loop construction:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  }
}
````

Which should you use? Whichever is easier for you to understand. Remember that
**most of the time spent programming is fixing problems**, and **whatever you
understand best will probably have fewer problems**.

Both `for()` loops and `while()` loops can be nested, meaning a loop inside a
loop:

````

function setup() {
  createCanvas(700, 700);
  background(230);
  fill(0);

  let yPos = 0;
  let xPos = 0;

  for (yPos = 30; yPos < height; yPos=yPos + 40) {
    for (xPos = 20; xPos<width; xPos=xPos + 40) {
      circle(xPos,yPos, 5);
    }
  }
}

````

Note that I've done all the above examples in `setup()` and not in `draw()`

#### Functions

Every time you use one of the built-in 'commands', you are really using (or
more properly 'calling') a built-in function. Functions are a very important
building block of programming, and in addition to using built-in functions,
you can also create your own. In fact, you've already been doing that, when
you created the `setup()` and `draw()` functions. In the case of
`setup()` and `draw()` you have to use those names, but when you create other
functions you can make up your own names. Just like variables names, good 
function names make your programs easier to understand.

Why create your own functions?

- Reuse (if it's something you might do again)
- Clarity (remember your three important audiences: yourself, others learning
	from you, me when I grade your work)
- Easier to debug (what is debugging?)
	- One of the most powerful ways to approach
	a bug is to reproduce it with simplest possible example. 
	This is much easier when the thing that's causing
	the problem is already a function.
- Modularity
- Flexibility (with good choice of parameters)

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    rect(foo, 50, 40, 40);
    line(foo, 50, foo+20, 30);
    line(foo+20, 30, foo+40, 50);
  }
}
````

Now let's make a function called `drawOneHouse()`. If we want to
draw a house at different locations, we need a way to tell
the function `drawOneHouse()` where to put the house. Functions accommodate
this by allowing us to pass information into the function by putting 
that information in the parenthesis. In the function, we store this
information in temporary variables that we can use in the function:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50) {
    drawOneHouseAt(foo);
  }
}

function drawOneHouseAt( x) {
  rect(x, 50, 40, 40);
  line(x, 50, x+20, 30);
  line(x+20, 30, x+40, 50);
}
````

**Notes**
1. I've said this before and I'll keep saying: 
	**Choose descriptive names for your variables and functions!** 
	`foo` is a bad name, `xPos` is a good name,
	 `houseXPos` is a better name.
1. The value of `foo` (50, 100, 150 ...) is the information passed to the
	 function so that the function can do it's work. The proper name for this
	 information is an **argument**
1. The variable `x` is a temporary variable that **only exists in the function**.
	 This variable is used to store the argument that was passed into the
	 function so that the function can do its work. Once the function is
	 finished, this variable is no longer needed and is destroyed. 
	 A variable used in this way is called a **parameter**
1. Functions may take zero, one, or multiple arguments. When you write 
	a function, you decide how many arguments you need. For example, we might
	have included the house size or roof height or house y location. (Of course
	when you use functions that someone else wrote 
	you must use the proper number of parameters.)
1. Functions can return information as well, for example the `random()`
	 function. Functions can either return one piece of information, or none.
	We will see later how to do this. 

#### Variable Scope (again)

````
let foo;  // this is a global variable, visible in all functions

function setup() {
  foo = 7;
}

function draw() {

  print(foo);

  let bar; // this is a local variable, visible only inside of draw()

  for (let i = 0; i < width/2; i++) { 
    // i is a local variable visible only inside this for() loop
    ellipse(i, height/2, 10,15);
  }
}
````

### Tuesday September 13, 2022

#### Review variables, variable scope, functions

#### Object oriented programming

Go over [this](https://p5js.org/examples/objects-objects.html) example

Now let's create one from scratch. 
1. First, let's make a ball bounce off all 4 walls of the canvas
2. Identify carefully and isolate what's in `setup()`, 
	what does the moving, and what does the drawing
3. Now carefully write the class:
	1. The code in `setup()` is most likely the *constructor*
	1. The moving code and the drawing code are most likely 
		the two member functions you'll need
1. Look at the example we did and see how to create the object from the class,
	 and how to call the member functions at the right times

Let's modify the functions (both constructor and member functions) to take
arguments

````
// Commented out is the way this would work without classes
// let xPos, yPos, xSpeed, ySpeed;

// function setup() {
//   createCanvas(400, 400);
//   xPos = width / 2;
//   yPos = random(100, 300);
//   xSpeed = 4;
//   ySpeed = 7;
// }

// function draw() {
//   background(220);

//   // move the ball
//   xPos += xSpeed;
//   yPos += ySpeed;

//   // check for collisions
//   // check first for left and right wall
//   if (xPos <= 15 || xPos >= (width-15)) {
//     xSpeed = -xSpeed;
//   }

//   // do the same for the ceiling and the floor
//   if (yPos <= 15 || yPos >= (height-15)) {
//     ySpeed = -ySpeed;
//   }

//   circle(xPos, yPos, 30);
// }

class BouncingBall {
  constructor() {
    this.xPos = width / 2;
    this.yPos = random(100, 300);
    this.xSpeed = 4;
    this.ySpeed = 7;
  }

  move() {
    // move the ball
    this.xPos += this.xSpeed;
    this.yPos += this.ySpeed;
  }

  checkForCollisions() {
    // check first for left and right wall
    if (this.xPos <= 15 || this.xPos >= width - 15) {
      this.xSpeed = -this.xSpeed;
    }

    // do the same for the ceiling and the floor
    if (this.yPos <= 15 || this.yPos >= height - 15) {
      this.ySpeed = -this.ySpeed;
    }
  }

  draw() {
    circle(this.xPos, this.yPos, 30);
  }
}

let myBouncingBall;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  myBouncingBall = new BouncingBall();
}

function draw() {
  background(240);
  myBouncingBall.move();
  myBouncingBall.checkForCollisions();
  myBouncingBall.draw();
}

````

[Here](https://editor.p5js.org/mangtronix/sketches/-7sWqG_Bu) is one solution

##### In class exercise
Write your own class to do something, perhaps inspired by the computer
graphics homework you just did. Start with something very simple, and slowly
add features. Or, do this:

Make a class that draws a square in the middle of the screen, and have it
slowly give the effect of breathing: slowly change size a little bigger and a
little smaller, and slowly change color slightly, at about the same rate of
breathing

How to use the modulo function to make something happen less often than every
frame: 

```
let shade = 0;
let amount = 5;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(shade);

  // change the shade only on every other frame
  if (frameCount % 2 == 0) {
    shade += amount;

    // make sure the shade stays between 0 and 255
    if (shade <= 0 || shade >= 255) {
      amount = -amount;
    }
  }
}
```

Now we learn about arrays. There is an example
[here](https://p5js.org/examples/arrays-array.html) but unfortunately it is a
little complex. The important things to notice are:
1. Creating the array `let ball = [];` the `[]` is what tells p5 that you're
	 making an array
2. Filling the array is what determines the size:
```
    if (this.xPos <= 15 || this.xPos >= width - 15) {
			ball[i] = new BouncingBall(i + 1, 2);
    }
```
Since we have put 10 values into the array, the array has 10 elements in it

Similarly, to access any element in the array you index into the array:
```
// Refer to the third element in the array (remember the index starts at 0):
ball[2];
```

Here then is the bouncing ball example, this time creating 10 
balls, and storing them in an array:

```
class BouncingBall {
  constructor(xSpeed0, ySpeed0) {
    this.xPos = width / 2;
    this.yPos = random(100, 300);
    this.xSpeed = xSpeed0;
    this.ySpeed = ySpeed0;
  }

  move() {
    // move the ball
    this.xPos += this.xSpeed;
    this.yPos += this.ySpeed;
  }

  checkForCollisions() {
    // check first for left and right wall
    if (this.xPos <= 15 || this.xPos >= width - 15) {
      this.xSpeed = -this.xSpeed;
    }

    // do the same for the ceiling and the floor
    if (this.yPos <= 15 || this.yPos >= height - 15) {
      this.ySpeed = -this.ySpeed;
    }
  }

  draw() {
    circle(this.xPos, this.yPos, 30);
  }
}

let ball = [];

function setup() {
  
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // each ball will have a slightly different
    // initial speed in the X axis, but all balls
    // will have the same speed in the Y axis
    ball[i] = new BouncingBall(i + 1, 2);
  }
}

function draw() {
  background(240);

  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ball[i].move();
    ball[i].checkForCollisions();
    ball[i].draw();
  }
}
```

[Here](https://p5js.org/examples/arrays-array-objects.html)
is another example showing how to make an array of objects

### Thursday September 15, 2022

#### Review Object oriented programming and arrays
- Classes are like cookie cutters; objects are like cookies
	- Naming conventions
- Classes contain both properties (size, color, speed, position, etc.) and
	behaviours (move, draw, bounce, etc.)

- Solutions to Tuesday's in-class exercise
	- How to make the box "pause" when it's off
	- How to center the box
- Aaron's [car](https://editor.p5js.org/aaronsherwood/sketches/eYFQE9EZa) 
	example
	- How to make the car "bump" a little

Maybe now we are prepared to analyze 
[this](https://p5js.org/examples/arrays-array-objects.html)
example. Sometimes it's good to go back to something that looked 
impossible earlier, to see whether it makes sense now (and to see how much
you've already learned!)

#### Look at next week's homework assignment
- Push your boundries! Try to do something you don't quite understand, bring
	it to class, and let's see if we can figure out how to do it
- Remember to save your code! 
- If you try different approaches, save them all, and describe them
	all in your blog post. Include those that work (if there are any)
	and those that don't work (if there are any).
	(You could name them September20_1, September20_2, or even
	September20_arraysBroken, September20_classesWorks)

#### Look at some more computer graphic assignments
- In particular, those that didn't quite do what you wanted

#### Make up discussion from last week
- Casey Reas: Mohamed Alhosani will lead the discussion

#### Transformations
Transformations move the coordinate system
so you can draw in different places with the same code
- Available 2D transforms are 
	- `translate()`
	- `rotate()`
	- `scale()`
- `push()` and `pop()` allow you to remember where the canvas was, 
and then return to it's last position

Example: Draw a house at a given location, no transform:

````
function house(int x, int y)
{
  triangle(x + 15, y, x, y + 15, x + 30, y + 15);
  rect(x, y + 15, 30, 30);
  rect(x + 12, y + 30, 10, 15);
}
````

Same result, but using a transform:

````
function house(x, y)
{
  translate(x, y);
  triangle(15, 0, 0, 15, 30, 15);
  rect(0, 15, 30, 30);
  rect(12, 30, 10, 15);
}
````

Why do this?
- Easier to read
- Easier to code complex motions relative to other motions

**Notes**
- Just like with 'fill()' and 'rectMode()', once you've moved the origin it
	stays there unless you return it to its starting position. E.g. try putting
	a circle in the center of the canvas 'ellipse (width/2, height/2, 20);'
- Whenever you do a transformation, it's good practice to **always** return
	the origin to where it was before using 'push()' and 'pop()':

````
function house(x, y)
{
	push();
  translate(x, y);
  triangle(15, 0, 0, 15, 30, 15);
  rect(0, 15, 30, 30);
  rect(12, 30, 10, 15);
	pop();
}
````

*Suggestion*
- I encourage you to see what the other section is up to; the other teacher and
I often exchange ideas and build on each other's examples and lectures. In
particular, Mang has curated a very nice list of [Additional
Resources](https://github.com/mangtronix/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#week-22-additional-resources)
on transformations.

##### Rotation and scaling 

'''
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400,400);
  background(240);

  // the red rectangle is drawn before the rotation so
  // it will stay in place
  fill(255, 0, 0);
  rect(200, 200, 100, 100);
  line(0, 0, 200, 200);

  // Now a green rectangle
  fill(0, 255, 0);

  // rotation is done here. all subsequent drawing
  // is done post-rotation
  rotate(radians(10));

  // the green rectangle is drawn after rotating the canvas
  rect(200, 200, 100, 100);
  line(0, 0, 200, 200);
}
'''

Work through 
[this](https://genekogan.com/code/p5js-transformations/) resource

#### Text

Basic default text:

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);

  text("My Important Message", width / 2, height / 2);
}
```

Picking fonts:

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
	textFont("Courier New", 25);

	text("My Important Message", width / 2, height / 2);
}
```

There are of course many other things you can do with text. You can look at Help->Reference->Typography and File->Examples->Typography for ideas and examples.

Some advanced examples using text are
[here](https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/tree/master/processingExamples)

Some awesome examples alas without code:

###### Finding data

Sources

- https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/rt_data_access.shtml
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
- Professor' Mathura's 
	[list of data sources](https://github.com/MathuraMG/ConnectionsLabSpring22/blob/master/Week_3_JSON_Fetch/README.md#list-of-data-sources)
 	
Format

- The most common format is CSV, especially as you can use any spreadsheet
	(Excel, OpenOffice Calc, Google Sheets) to export any table in CSV format
- Other formats are JSON and XML. We won't spend much time on them, but there
	are p5.js libraries available for parsing them


##### Worked example: Getting and working with a CSV file

- A [database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/) of energy generated by wind turbines
- Click "Get Data"
- Scroll down a bit to "Tabular Data: CSV format" and click on "CSV
format".
	- This will download a `.zip` file.
- Unzip the file.
	- This will create `uswtdb_v4_1_20210721.csv`
- This is a plain text file; you can view it with a text editor
	- You will see that the first line is the heading of each column
	- Some of the fields are numerical (e.g. case_id)
	- Some of the fields are text (e.g. t_state, t_county)
	- Some of the fields are missing (e.g. faa_ors, faa_asn)
- Now you can load this file into an array of `Strings` and then process each
	line one at a time, pulling out individual fields:

// An array of strings to hold the entire file
let strings = [];

// For scaling, we want to know the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude
let minLat;
let maxLat;
let minLong;

    // Put a mark there
    point(xpos, ypos);

Things to notice:
1. The `split()` function does half the magic
1. The `int()` or `float()` function does much of the rest
1. data files might have errors in them and you need to defend your program
	 against them
1. `loop()` and `noLoop()` can be used anytime you want to start or stop the
	 `draw()` function from repeating


##### JSON and XML: Other file formats

JSON and XML are other format for organizing data in a file.
They are more complex than CSV, and again p5.js provides functions.

##### Generative Text
Pull words from a CSV file
and by using `random()` in a clever way,
write poems or slogans or whatever.

Here is a terribly lame example:

````
/*
Generate poetry from a file of words
 the file has words in this format:

 roses,red,violets,blue,dream,disneyland

 we will refer to them as:

 item1,color1,item2,color2,verb,location

 and construct a poem:

 item1 are color1, item2 are color2
 when I verb I verb to location
 */

// Let's put the index of the word into numbers:
const ITEM1 = 0;
const COLOR1 = 1;
const ITEM2 = 2;
const COLOR2 = 3;
const VERB = 4;
const LOCATION = 5;
// final means that I will not change these variables
// It is conventional to use all caps for variable names that will not change


let strings = [];

function setup() {

  // The text from the file is loaded into an array.
  strings = loadStrings("words.csv");

  // How many lines did we get?
 // println("strings array contains this many lines: " + strings.length);
}

let csvRowNumber = 0;

function draw() {
  let singleRow = [];

  // First line: "item1 are color1, item2 are color2"

  // Pick a random number, round that number DOWN to a whole number,
  // and split that row into individual words
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get item1
  let item1 = singleRow[ITEM1] + " are " ;

  // Now keep doing this for each word
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get color1
  let color1 = singleRow[COLOR1] + ", " ;

  // Now the second half of the first line: "violets are blue"
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  let item2 = singleRow[ITEM2] + " are " ;
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get color2
  let color2 =  singleRow[COLOR2];

  // that's the end of the first line of the poem
  print(item1 + " are " + color1 ", " + item2 + " are " + color2);

  // Now the second line: when I verb I verb of location

  message = "When I " ;
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[VERB]);
  print(" I " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[VERB]);
  print(" to the " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[LOCATION]);

  // that's the end of the second line of the poem so start a new line
  // and also put an extra blank line
  print('\n');
  print('\n');

  noLoop(); // Wait for a mouse click then do it again
}

// If you click the mouse, allow the draw() function to resume
function mouseClicked() {
  loop();
}
````

and this is an example of the words you can feed it.
put these contents into a file called `words.csv`:

````
roses,red,violets,blue,dream,disneyland
robots,silver,pencils,grey,run,supermarket
goldfish,orange,motors,white,turn,workbench
books,multicolored,lamposts,azure,swim,island
computers,black,mice,pink,squeak,home
````

(Time permitting)
#### More Data Visualization and generative text:


- have students make a scroller in pairs
- add randomness/perlin noise
- have them look at circle letters, come up with questions and explanations in
pairs
- have students work through example on their own and use data
- show generative word from circles sketch
