### January 27

#### Announcements

- I made a mistake and had to change the Zoom meeting URL. I have updated all
	the pages on Github with the new Zoom URL which is
	[this](https://nyu.zoom.us/j/98127583237)
- Since the first meeting was with the old link, you won't be able to
	find that meeting recording in Brightspace. However you can access
	the first meeting recording
	[here](https://nyu.zoom.us/rec/share/39WzmzYv5s5_mVmNTASLwR676e1uvgySeVXj1UkNXA6UjVoFgr2z5pMAN1ETIsqh.zbuDSymgupqIzpzF)


#### Let's get started

##### Github
- What is Github?
- Difference between an account and a repository
- Follow along with me and create an account
- Instructions for this are
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources).

Please use your name for your account name so that I can more easily recognize
it.  If you don't want to use your name for privacy reasons, please choose an
alias that I can recognize as you.

Name your repository "introduction to interactive Media". 

- Edit your README.md file
	- What is README.md?
	- What is .md?
- Simple Markdown 
	- **Bold**
	- Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line
	- Inserting images: ![](media/eye-calipers.jpg)
	- Always remember to commit your changes!
	- More [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources).


##### Simple shapes in p5.js

Open [p5.js editor](editor.p5.js/)

- `ellipse()`
- `rect()`
- `createCanvas()`
- `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
- `line()`
- `point()`

What does this all mean?
- Functions
- Arguments or parameters

Controlling color, fill, and stroke

- `stroke()`
- `noStroke()`
- `fill()`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 180)`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, radians(180), CHORD)`

Here is the program we developed in class:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600,600); 
  background(25, 130, 80); 
  
  // draw a circle and a rectangle with the default colors
  circle (width/2, height/2, 50);
  rect(10, 10, 80, 20);
  
  // change the stroke and fill
  fill(180,0,0);
  stroke(0,0,180);
  // circle(80, 80, 80); this circle is commented out so it won't be drawn
  ellipse(200, 280, 50, 80);
  
  // change the stroke color but keep the same fill
  stroke(180,0,0);
  line( 0,0, 300, 100);
  
  let foo = radians(90);
  prlet(foo);                  //!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS VERY USEFUL!!!!!!!
  
  arc(50, 55, // center of the ellipse
      50, 50, // width and height
      0, radians(180)); // start and stop angle
  
  triangle( 100, 100, 10, 200, 100, 300);
  polet(width/2, height/2);
}

let x = 0;
function draw() {
	// Where am I poleting?
  prlet(mouseX, mouseY);
  
	// I can do animation!
  circle(x, 500, 40);
  x=x+1;
}

````
**Notes**
- Built-in variables
	- `width`, `height`, `mouseX`, `mouseY`
	- many others; we will discover more as we go along

**Notice that when working in the web editor your sketches are not
saved!**
- You can create an account on p5.js if you wish for your own use
but all class assignments must be handed in on Github.
- Github is designed to save works in progress. It is not only permissible to
	save unfinished work, it is advisable so that work doesn't get lost
- Github tracks changes so you can go back to any previous commit
- This saves you from having multiple versions of a program on your laptop
- You can even compare different commits to see what changes you made 
	between them

##### Saving a sketch to Github

- Navigate to desired folder
- Click on "Add file" 
- Select "Create new file"
- Type in optional new folder(s) followed by slashes `/` followed by a file
	name
- Copy your code from the p5.js editor and paste it into Github
- Scroll down to the bottom
- Optionally change the commit comment
- Click on "Commit new file"

### February 1

#### Homework
Look at self portraits

#### Questions
Did any questions come up since we last met?

##### Variables

- Javascript is not a typed language: you don't need to declare
	a variable's type
- `let myNumber = 4.5;`
- `let myString = "the quick brown fox";`
- `let myArray = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"];`
- `let myRandomNumber = random(255);`
- `let myRandomNumber = round(random(255));`
How can we find out what a variable's value is?
`print()` 

##### Animation

Use the `draw()` function to draw something different in each frame. This can
be the location of a shape but you can manipulate anything such as color also:

The  `draw()` function is called once per frame. Think of it as drawing a new
page on a ["flip book"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_book)

````
let foo = 0;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  foo = foo + 1;
}
````

By default, the previous frame is not erased. Sometimes this is useful.
Use the `background()` function to "paint" over any previous drawings. 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 500);
}

let triangleTopLeftX = 0;
let redValue = 255;

function draw() {
  // erase previous drawings
  background(10, 255, 255);

  // Move the triangle
  triangleTopLeftX = triangleTopLeftX + 1;

	// If the triangle reaches the right edge, move to the left edge
  if (triangleTopLeftX >= width) {
    triangleTopLeftX = 0;
  }

  // Change the value of red
  redValue = redValue - 1;

	//If red reaches a certian level, reset it
  if (redValue === 55) {
		redValue = 255;
	}

  // Select the fill for the triangle
  fill(redValue, redValue - 100, redValue - 100);

  // Draw the triangle
  triangle(
    triangleTopLeftX,
    20, // top left corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 100,
    30, // top right corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 50,
    200
  ); // bottom corner
  
  // Select the fill for the circle
  fill(10,20, 240);

  // Draw the circle
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 30);
  print("mouse coordinates = " + mouseX + ", " + mouseY);
}

````

##### Notes:

- Local vs. Global variables
- Built-in variables

````
// Example usage of a global variable

let count; // this is now a global variable

function setup() {
  circle(50, 50, 30);
  count = 7; // the variable is initialized here
}

function draw() {
  count = count + 1; // not algebra!
  // The result of the right hand side calculation
  // replaces whatever value was stored in the variable
  // on the left side of the '=' sign
  // end result: the variable "count" is incremented by 1

  print (count);
}
````

##### What is `frameRate()`?

````
function setup() {
  frameRate(10);       // frameRate() is a function
  print(frameRate()); // it takes awhile for the frame rate to change
}

function draw() {
  print(frameRate());
}
````

### February 3
#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- Please say something if I forget the end of class
- Attention
	- Cameras on
	- Notifications off
	- Pay attention to whomever is talking
	- Failure to do this will be marked as an unexcused absence

##### Review

- conditionals 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed === true) {
    background(color(0, 0, 255));
  } else {
    background(color(200, 0, 0));
  }
}
````

**Notes**:
1. `mouseIsPressed` is another built-in variable. There are many others.
1. `mouseIsPressed` is a new type of data, namely a `boolean`, 
	which means it has
	 only one of two values, `true` or `false`
1. Note that `{` and `}` indicate the blocks
1. The `else` part of an `if()` statement is optional (what happens if we
	 remove it?)

In class exercise:
- Using the cursor to draw
- Now use a mouse press to clear the screen
- Clear the screen if the mouse is pressed inside a certain circle
- Combine these to create a primitive painting program

##### Loops
`while()` is like `if()` but it keeps on doing it as long as condition is true

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  let foo = 50; // create and initialize a variable

  while (foo < width) { // keep going as long as the condition is true
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
		// modify the variable so something different happens next time
    foo = foo + 50; 
  }
}
````

1. You should get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your variables.
	1. What is a better name for the variable foo?
1. What would happen if you replace the `while()` with `if()`?

There is another way to make a loop using the keyword `for()`. The `for()`
loop structure combines the initialization step and the incrementation step
into the `for()` loop construction:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  }
}
````

Which should you use? Whichever is easier for you to understand. Remember that
**most of the time spent programming is fixing problems**, and **whatever you
understand best will probably have fewer problems**.

Both `for()` loops and `while()` loops can be nested, meaning a loop inside a
loop:

````

function setup() {
  createCanvas(700, 700);
  background(230);
  fill(0);

  let yPos = 0;
  let xPos = 0;

  for (yPos = 30; yPos < height; yPos=yPos + 40) {
    for (xPos = 20; xPos<width; xPos=xPos + 40) {
      circle(xPos,yPos, 5);
    }
  }
}

````

#### Functions

Every time you use one of the built-in 'commands', you are really using (or
more properly 'calling') a built-in function. Functions are a very important
building block of programming, and in addition to using built-in functions,
you can also create your own. In fact, you've already been doing that, when
you created the `setup()` and `draw()` functions. In the case of
`setup()` and `draw()` you have to use those names, but when you create other
functions you can make up your own names. Just like variables names, good 
function names make your programs easier to understand.

Why create your own functions?

- Reuse (if it's something you might do again)
- Clarity (remember your three important audiences: yourself, others learning
	from you, me when I grade your work)
- Easier to debug (what is debugging?)
	- One of the most powerful ways to approach
	a bug is to reproduce it with simplest possible example. 
	This is much easier when the thing that's causing
	the problem is already a function.
- Modularity
- Flexibility (with good choice of parameters)

Let's modify the example from last class to use a function. First let's draw a
house instead of a circle to make it a little more interesting:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    rect(foo, 50, 40, 40);
    line(foo, 50, foo+20, 30);
    line(foo+20, 30, foo+40, 50);
  }
}
````

Now let's make a function called `drawOneHouse()`. If we want to
draw a house at different locations, we need a way to tell
the function `drawOneHouse()` where to put the house. Functions accommodate
this by allowing us to pass information into the function by putting 
that information in the parenthesis. In the function, we store this
information in temporary variables that we can use in the function:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50) {
    drawOneHouseAt(foo);
  }
}

function drawOneHouseAt( x) {
  rect(x, 50, 40, 40);
  line(x, 50, x+20, 30);
  line(x+20, 30, x+40, 50);
}
````

**Notes**
1. I've said this before and I'll keep saying: 
	**Choose descriptive names for your variables and functions!** 
	`foo` is a bad name, `xPos` is a good name,
	 `houseXPos` is a better name.
1. The value of `foo` (50, 100, 150 ...) is the information passed to the
	 function so that the function can do it's work. The proper name for this
	 information is an **argument**
1. The variable `x` is a temporary variable that **only exists in the function**.
	 This variable is used to store the argument that was passed into the
	 function so that the function can do its work. Once the function is
	 finished, this variable is no longer needed and is destroyed. 
	 A variable used in this way is called a **parameter**
1. Functions may take zero, one, or multiple arguments. When you write 
	a function, you decide how many arguments you need. For example, we might
	have included the house size or roof height or house y location. (Of course
	when you use functions that someone else wrote 
	you must use the proper number of parameters.)
1. Functions can return information as well, for example the `random()`
	 function. Functions can either return one piece of information, or none.
	We will see later how to do this. 

#### Variable Scope (again)

````
let foo;  // this is a global variable, visible in all functions

function setup() {
  foo = 7;
}

function draw() {

  print(foo);

  let bar; // this is a local variable, visible only inside of draw()

  for (let i = 0; i < width/2; i++) { 
    // i is a local variable visible only inside this for() loop
    ellipse(i, height/2, 10,15);
  }
}
````


### February 8

##### Discuss reading

##### Functions

Any questions about what we've covered already?

Functions that return a value: See the [reference page for
`return`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/return)

**Notes**
- Functions can take any number of arguments (or none), but can return at most
one

In class exercise:

1. Write a function that will take a single parameter
and draw a vertical line from the top of the canvas to the bottom
at the X coordinate indicated by the parameter
	1. In the `setup()` function test your function 
	at a couple of different locations
1. Write another function that will draw a **horizontal** line
at the indicated **Y** coordinate
	1. Test as before
1. Using these two functions, write a program in `setup()`
that draws a grid of lines at regular intervals on the canvas

#### Callback Functions

`MouseClicked()` [example](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseClicked) in
the reference section

**Notes**
- You never have to call **callback functions**. The p5.js system calls them
	for you when that event happens


````
const redLocationX = 40;
const redLocationY = 40;

const blueLocationX = 80;
const blueLocationY = 40;

const menuSizeX = 120
const menuSizeY = 80;

const circleDiameter = 40;
const backgroundColor = 240;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400,400);

  //prepare background
  background(backgroundColor);

  // Put a box around the menu. We won't be allowed to draw here
  rect(0,0, menuSizeX, menuSizeY);

  // draw red circle
  fill (255,0,0);
  circle(redLocationX, redLocationY, circleDiameter);

  // now blue
  fill (0, 0, 255);
  circle(blueLocationX, blueLocationY, circleDiameter);

  // initialize fill to green
  fill (0, 255, 0);

  // turn off stroke
  noStroke();

  // faster refresh rate makes line more solid
  frameRate(200);
}

function draw() {

  if (mouseIsPressed &&
      !mouseIsWithinRect(0, 0, menuSizeX, menuSizeY)) {
    circle(mouseX, mouseY, 15);
  }
}

function mouseClicked() {

   // Have we chosen red?
  if (mouseIsWithinCircle(redLocationX, redLocationY, circleDiameter/2)) {
    console.log("you chose red!");
    fill (255,0,0);
  }

  // Have we chosen blue?
  if (mouseIsWithinCircle(blueLocationX, blueLocationY, circleDiameter/2)) {
    console.log("you chose blue!");
    fill (0, 0, 255);
  }

}

function mouseIsWithinCircle( x, y, radius) {
  if (dist(mouseX, mouseY, x, y) < radius) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

function mouseIsWithinRect( x, y, sizeX, sizeY) {
  if (mouseX > x &&
      mouseX < x + sizeX &&
      mouseY > y &&
      mouseY < y + sizeY) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

````

**Notes**
- Operator precedence is [very
	complicated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence). It is best to put parenthesis to
	force the order you want.

### February 10

#### Topics today
- Finish walking through the "paint" program from Thursday
- Arrays
- Object Oriented Programming 
- Transformations

#### Arrays

Very simply, arrays let you store multiple things under one variable name, and
let you identify which thing you want by using an `index`


````
function setup() {
  const numberOfValues = 10;

  let values = []

  let n = 0;
  while (n < numberOfValues ) {
    values.push( n * n );
    n = n + 1;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
    print(values[i]);
  }
}
````

**Things to notice**

- Similar to the way functions are signified by `()`, 
	arrays are signified by `[]`
- Arrays can be of any data type, but can't be mixed types
- New keyword: `const` 
- Why not just use ten "normal" variables?
- Arrays and loops (either `for()` or `while()`) almost always show up
  together. If you have an array, you almost always want a loop.
- Note that the `while()` loop used to put the numbers into the array
	is exactly the same as the `for()` loop used to print the array. I could
	have used either in both places. I did this to show you that they are
	interchangeable.

#### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Walk through
[this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/tree/master/src/p5jsSketches/simpleP5jsClassExample)

  text("My Important Message", width / 2, height / 2);
}
````

###### Different Fonts

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
	textFont("Courier New", 25);

	text("My Important Message", width / 2, height / 2);
}
````

Fonts that seem to be available are 'Courier New' (monospace),
and 'Helvetica' (non-monospace)

You can also load your own fonts but that requires uploading them to the p5.js
server

Help->Reference->LoadFont

**Important**: Note that p5.js is asynchronous, 
meaning that `setup()` will continue even if the `loadFont()` hasn't finished.
There are two ways to force your program to wait for the font to load:

1. Use `preLoad()`
1. Specify an optional callback function in `loadFont()`

###### Selecting one of many fonts

Note that loading a font takes time, so if you expect to use multiple
fonts it's best to preload all of them, and then switch between
them using [`textFont()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/textFont)

###### Other things to do with text

There are of course many other things you can do with text. You can look at 
Help->Reference->Typography and File->Examples->Typography for ideas and
examples.

##### Data Visualization

What is data visualization? Here are some examples:

- [Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/allstreets/)
- [Aaron Koblin](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/project/flight-patterns)
- [Jer Thorp](https://www.jerthorp.com/portfolio) e.g. Cascade

###### Finding data

Sources

- https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/
- https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/rt_data_access.shtml
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
- Professor' Mathura's [list of data
	sources](https://github.com/MathuraMG/ConnectionsLabSpring22/blob/master/Week_3_JSON_Fetch/README.md#list-of-data-sources)
 	
Format

- The most common format is CSV. You can create your own CSV file from a 
	spreadsheet because most programs
	(Excel, OpenOffice Calc, Google Sheets) can export any table in CSV format
- Other formats are JSON and XML. We won't spend any time on them, but there
	are Processing and probably p5.js libraries for parsing these.
	are p5.js libraries for these.

##### Worked example: Getting and working with a CSV file

- A [database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/) of energy generated by wind turbines
- Click "Get Data"
- Scroll down a bit to "Tabular Data: CSV format" and click on "CSV
format". 
	- This will download a `.zip` file.
- Unzip the file. 
	- This will create `uswtdb_v4_1_20210721.csv`
- This is a plain text file; you can view it with a text editor
	- You will see that the first line is the heading of each column
	- Some of the fields are numerical (e.g. case_id)
	- Some of the fields are text (e.g. t_state, t_county)
	- Some of the fields are missing (e.g. faa_ors, faa_asn)
- Now you can load this file into an array of `Strings` and then process each
	line one at a time, pulling out individual fields:

````


Things to notice:
1. The `split()` function does half the magic
1. The `int()` or `float()` function does much of the rest
1. data files might have errors in them and you need to defend your program
	 against them
1. `loop()` and `noLoop()` can be used anytime you want to start or stop the
	 `draw()` function from repeating


##### JSON and XML: Other file formats

JSON and XML are other format for organizing data in a file. 
They are more complex than CSV, and again Processing provides functions.

##### Generative Text
Pull words from a CSV file 
and by using `random()` in a clever way,
write poems or slogans or whatever. 

Here is a terribly lame example:

````
/*
Generate poetry from a file of words
 the file has words in this format:

 roses,red,violets,blue,dream,disneyland

 we will refer to them as:

 item1,color1,item2,color2,verb,location

 and construct a poem:

 item1 are color1, item2 are color2
 when I verb I verb to location
 */

// Let's put the index of the word into numbers:
const ITEM1 = 0;
const COLOR1 = 1;
const ITEM2 = 2;
const COLOR2 = 3;
const VERB = 4;
const LOCATION = 5;
// final means that I will not change these variables
// It is conventional to use all caps for variable names that will not change


let strings = [];

function setup() {

  // The text from the file is loaded into an array.
  strings = loadStrings("words.csv");

  // How many lines did we get?
 // println("strings array contains this many lines: " + strings.length);
}

let csvRowNumber = 0;

function draw() {
  let singleRow = [];

  // First line: "item1 are color1, item2 are color2"

  // Pick a random number, round that number DOWN to a whole number,
  // and split that row into individual words
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get item1
  let item1 = singleRow[ITEM1] + " are " ;

  // Now keep doing this for each word
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get color1
  let color1 = singleRow[COLOR1] + ", " ;

  // Now the second half of the first line: "violets are blue"
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  let item2 = singleRow[ITEM2] + " are " ;
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get color2
  let color2 =  singleRow[COLOR2];

  // that's the end of the first line of the poem
  print(item1 + " are " + color1 ", " + item2 + " are " + color2);

  // Now the second line: when I verb I verb of location

  message = "When I " ;
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[VERB]);
  print(" I " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[VERB]);
  print(" to the " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[LOCATION]);

  // that's the end of the second line of the poem so start a new line
  // and also put an extra blank line
  print('\n');
  print('\n');

  noLoop(); // Wait for a mouse click then do it again
}

// If you click the mouse, allow the draw() function to resume
function mouseClicked() {
  loop();
}
````

and this is an example of the words you can feed it. 
put these contents into a file called `words.csv`:

````
roses,red,violets,blue,dream,disneyland
robots,silver,pencils,grey,run,supermarket
goldfish,orange,motors,white,turn,workbench
books,multicolored,lamposts,azure,swim,island
computers,black,mice,pink,squeak,home
````

### February 22
#### Plan for today: 

- Discussion
- Homework feedback to all
- Look at some homework
- Working with images!
- The `pixels` array (time permitting)
- Sound (time permitting)
- Introducing midterm (time permitting)

#### Homework feedback to all:

- Better comments. I should be able to read your code and comments and
	completely understand your program.
	- Your code should explain what is really happening. 
		`things = 2; // increase the number of things` is wrong. It is setting
		the number of things to 2, not increasing the number of things.
- Better formatting:
	- Remove unnecessary spaces
	- Break long lines (both code and comments) into short lines. A line
		should fit in the p5.js editor window.
- Remove unnecessary functions, or explain why they are there
- Remove unnecessary variables, or explain why they are there
- Instead of naming functions thing1, thing2, thing3, give them
	meaningful names like happyFace, sadFace, and surprisedFace
- Any time you have more than 2 or 3 objects they should probably be in an
	array. If there is a reason not to have them in an array you need to
	explain why in the comments.
- Read the assignment carefully and make sure you provide everything that 
is requested
- If `draw()` is empty explain why
- Don't include your entire program in the README.md. You may include short
	pieces to augment your description.
- Explain the arguments to functions, or better yet, use names that are so 
	clear that no comments are needed. `constructor(wid,hgt,rnd,clr)` I could
	guess that `wid` is width and `hgt` is height, but why not use the full
	word? You are all fast typists. Better yet, if you are drawing e.g. a
	car, name the variables `carWidth` and `carHeight`. `clr` and `rnd` I
	could not figure out except by seeing how they were used, but I shouldn't
	have to do that.
- A function that only calls another function e.g.
	is almost certainly pointless.
	if there is a reason, it should be explained.
````
foo() {
	this.bar()
}
````
- If code is commented out, explain why
- If the video clip is in your Github repo, embed it in the README.md
	- If the video clip is on Vimeo or YouTube, put a link in your README.md
- Tidy your code before putting it on Github
- Use the correct suffix for your variables, classes, and functions. If a
	class defines a single car, don't call it `cars`. If individual cars are
	then gathered in an array of multiple cars, don't call it `arrayCar`.
- Try to avoid hardcoded or magic numbers. 
	Use built-in variables (`width/2` instead
	of `const CENTER = 200`) whenever possible. If you must use numbers
	explain why.
- Start your homework early so that there is time to meet with me if you
	need help. I'm willing to meet on the weekend but not late Monday night.

#### Working with images!

The `p5.Image` class
- Just another class, i.e. it has
	- Data (the pixels, width, height, etc.)
	- Functionality `(image()`, `get()`, etc.)

````
let catImg;
function preload() {
  photo = loadImage("https://placekitten.com/400/400");
}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(255);
  image(photo, 0, 0); // this actually displays the image
}
````

- `image(photo, positionX, positionY, width, height)` - display 
this image at this location and scale to this size
- `photo.resize(w,h)` - scale to this size. If one of the arguments is zero,
	then scale to the remaining argument and retain the original aspect ratio.
- `photo.get(x,y,w,h)` - Returns a new p5.Image containing a portion of the image
- `photo.get(x,y)` - Returns the color of the pixel at this location

````
let catImg;
function preload() {
  catImg = loadImage("https://placekitten.com/400/400");
}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(255);
  image(catImg, 0, 0);

  let newImg = catImg.get( 50,60, 100,50);
  image (newImg, 250, 200);
}
````

- Pixels array
- Sprite sheets

#### The `pixels` array: Treating the canvas as an image

You can access individual pixels 
from the canvas (and whatever is on the canvas)
using the special built-in array called `pixels`. 
Before using this array you must load everything from the canvas 
into the `pixels` array using the `loadPixels()` function, 
and after making any changes you must call `updatePixels()` 
to write from the `pixels` array back to the canvas
if you want to make the changes visible

````
function setup() {
  let pink = color(255, 102, 204);
  loadPixels();
  let d = pixelDensity();
  let halfImage = 4 * (width * d) * ((height / 2) * d);
  for (let i = 0; i < halfImage; i += 4) {
    pixels[i] = red(pink);
    pixels[i + 1] = green(pink);
    pixels[i + 2] = blue(pink);
    pixels[i + 3] = alpha(pink);
  }
  updatePixels();
}
````

- The pixels array is one-dimensional, 
meaning if you want to go to a different row on the canvas 
you need to offset by that many widths
- Each pixel occupies 4 positions in the array
- Thus the equation for accessing a given pixel is
   (x + y * width) * 4
- Remember to set `pixelDensity(1);` in case you have a high 
resolution display


````
function setup() {
  pixelDensity(1);

	// blue background 
	// makes it easier to see the pink
  background(0, 102, 204);

  loadPixels();

	// Here is the equation 
	// for the start (red value) 
	// of a pixel 
	// at a particular coordinate (x,y)
  // (x + y*width) * 4

  // Change most of the fiftieth row to pink
  // instead of the whole line, 
	// only do from x = 10 to x = 90
  for (let i = (10 + 50 * width) * 4;
       i < (90 + 50 * width) * 4;
       i += 4) {

		// pink
    pixels[i + 0] = 255;
    pixels[i + 1] = 102;
    pixels[i + 2] = 204;
    pixels[i + 3] = 100;
  }

	// this puts the array back on the screen
  updatePixels();
}
````

It's important to remember that a pixel is just four numbers
so you can manipulate pixels mathematically 
e.g. make it fade:

````
function setup() {
  pixelDensity(1);
  background(0, 102, 204);
}

let redValue = 0; 

function draw() {

  loadPixels();
  
  for (let i = 0; i < width * height * 4 ; i+=4) {
    pixels[i] = redValue;
  } 
  updatePixels();

  redValue = (redValue + 1 ) %255
  print(redValue);
  
  updatePixels();

}
````

Just for fun, here is the last example from the video where Dan
created a random (only in the green channel) background:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(256,256);
  pixelDensity(1);
}

function draw() {
  loadPixels();
  for (var y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    for (var x = 0; x < width; x++) {
      var index = (x + y * width) * 4;

      pixels[index + 0] = x;
      // red value changes horizontally

      pixels[index + 1] = random(255);
      // green value random

      pixels[index + 2] = y;
      // blue value changes vertically

      pixels[index + 3] = 255;
      // no transparency
    }
  }
  updatePixels();
}
````

HERE

Look at the reference page for the pixels array

A fun examples from Professor Sherwood:

![](media/circularImages.png)

````
let tiles = [];
let tileSize = 100;

function preload() {
  img = loadImage("aiweiwei.jpeg");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  let numTiles = img.height / tileSize;
  while (numTiles > 0) {
    tiles.push(
      img.get(
        int(random(img.width - tileSize)),
        int(random(img.height - tileSize)),
        tileSize,
        tileSize
      )
    );
    numTiles--;
  }
  imageMode(CENTER);
}

function draw() {
  push();
  translate(width / 2, height / 2);

  let numSegments = 10;
  let eachAngle = TWO_PI / numSegments;
  let whichImage = int(random(tiles.length));

  for (let i = 0; i < numSegments; i++) {
    let x = cos(eachAngle * i) * tileSize + 1;
    let y = sin(eachAngle * i) * tileSize + 1;
    push();
    translate(x, y);
    rotate(eachAngle * i);
    image(tiles[whichImage], 0, 0);
    pop();
  }

  pop();
  noLoop();
}

function keyPressed() {
  loop();
}
````

Can we use a sequence of images for animation?

![](https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/blob/master/processingExamples/pixels/spritesheet/data/walking.png)

How would we use them?

Aaron's
[method](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/master/processingExamples/pixels/spritesheet/spritesheet.pde)

#### Working with a camera: Computer Vision!

- Add the video library
	- Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library
	- Filter by video
	- Install the *Video | GStreamer-based video library for Processing*

Try
[this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/src/processingSketches/computerVision/frameDifferencing/frameDifferencing.pde) example

#### Perlin Noise

````
void draw() {
  background(204);
  float n = random(0, width);
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
````

What if we wanted the line to move in a more organic, lifelike
fashion? Organic things (e.g. butterflies, leaves blowing in the wind, clouds) 
don't jump instantly from one place to another,
they tend to move close to where they were last time

````
float offset = 0.0;

void draw() {
  background(204);
  offset = offset + .01;
  float n = noise(offset) * width;
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
````

Things to notice:

* Why is the variable `offset` global? (Remember our discussion of variable
	scope)

#### Events

````
final int maxColors = 10;
color[] myColors = new color[maxColors];

int colorChoice = 0;

void setup() {
  size(600, 500);

  for (int i = 0; i < myColors.length; i ++ ) {
    myColors[i]=color(random(255), random(255), random(255));
  }
}

void draw() {
}

void mousePressed() {
  background(myColors[colorChoice]);
  colorChoice ++;
}
````

Things to notice:

* How does the background change if I never call `mousePressed()`?
`mousePressed()` is a *callback function*, meaning we have told
Processing that we are interested in this event, and if it occurs,
call this function. There are many different types of events available in
Processing, and you register an interest in them by creating a callback
function with the appropriate name. See *mouse* and *keyboard* 
in the Processing Reference Page.

* What happens if I click the mouse more than 10 times?  

##### Array Lists

Arrays are great, but they are of fixed size. There is an extension of the
array concept called an ArrayList which allows the size to be manipulated
dynamically.

Here is a short example showing how to work with ArrayLists:

````
class Thing {
  int i;
  float f;
  
  Thing(int _i, float _f) {
    i = _i;
    f = _f;
  }
  
  int getInt() {
    return i;
  }
  
  float getFloat() {
    return f;
  }
}

ArrayList<Thing> myThings = new ArrayList<Thing>();

void setup() {

  // The ArrayList should be empty
  println(myThings.size());

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    myThings.add(new Thing(i, float(i)));
    println(myThings.size()); // not that size() is a function!
  }

  // The value at index 5 should be 5
  // Just like arrays, the index starts at zero
  // so index 5 is the sixth item
  println("at index 5, x = " + myThings.get(5).getInt());
}

void mouseClicked() {
  myThings.add(new Thing(mouseX, mouseY));
  println("added a new Thing at mouse location x = " + mouseX + " y = " + mouseY);
}

void keyPressed() {
  if (key == 'd') {
    myThings.remove(0); // remove the first vector
    println("removed the first Thing, array size is now " + myThings.size());
  }

  if (key == 'p') {
    for (int i = 0; i < myThings.size(); i++) {
      Thing t = myThings.get(i);
      println("index = " + i + " int = " + t.getInt() + " y = " + t.getFloat());
    }
  }
}

// Need to have a draw() function so that callbacks occur
void draw() {
}
````

#### Documentation

- Midterm documentation must be excellent
	- Include photos, sketches, GIFS as appropriate
- Include block at the beginning of the code
- ^T
- Unused variables or functions
- Commented out code

#### Sound

Sound library [reference
page](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/index.html)

##### Install the Sound library

- Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library (notice many other library
	options)
- Search for Sound
- Install *Sound* written by *The Processing Foundation*

##### Playing with examples

- File -> Examples -> Libraries -> Sound -> Soundfile -> Keyboard
- File -> Examples -> Contributed Examples -> Learning Processing ->
chp_20_sound -> example_20_02_sound_effect
	- The sound file *beat.mp3* has never worked for me


##### Working in groups: 
If we had multiple sound files, how would we play the
next one when we click the mouse?

import processing.sound.*; //* load the sound library

SoundFile[] songs;
final int numberOfSongs = 5;

SoundFile currentSong;

void setup() {
  size(400, 500);

  songs = new SoundFile[numberOfSongs]; // makes the array of songs

  // open each file and put it in the songs array
  for (int i = 0; i< numberOfSongs; i++) {
    songs[i] = new SoundFile( this, "/tmp/" + (i+1) + ".aif");
  }
  currentSong = songs[0];
}

void draw() {
}

void mousePressed() {

  if (currentSong.isPlaying() == false ) {
    int songToPlay = (int) random(numberOfSongs);
    songs[songToPlay].play();
    currentSong = songs[songToPlay];
  }
}

##### Blocking vs. non-blocking functions

- Which function is non-blocking?
- How do you know when a non-blocking function is done?

##### Working in groups: 
Use the mouse position to select sound tracks

Try to work it out on your own before looking at the

##### Synthesis

- File -> Examples -> Libraries -> Sound -> Oscillators -> SineWave
- File -> Examples -> Libraries -> Sound -> Effects -> BandPassFilter

We can create our own complex sounds starting with basic oscillators and then
changing the envelopes. [Example](https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/blob/master/processingExamples/sound/synthesis/synthesis.pde)
