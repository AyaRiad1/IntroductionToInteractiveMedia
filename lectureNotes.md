### January 27

#### Announcements

- I made a mistake and had to change the Zoom meeting URL. I have updated all
	the pages on Github with the new Zoom URL which is
	[this](https://nyu.zoom.us/j/98127583237)
- Since the first meeting was with the old link, you won't be able to
	find that meeting recording in Brightspace. However you can access
	the first meeting recording
	[here](https://nyu.zoom.us/rec/share/39WzmzYv5s5_mVmNTASLwR676e1uvgySeVXj1UkNXA6UjVoFgr2z5pMAN1ETIsqh.zbuDSymgupqIzpzF)


#### Let's get started

##### Github
- What is Github?
- Difference between an account and a repository
- Follow along with me and create an account
- Instructions for this are
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources).

Please use your name for your account name so that I can more easily recognize
it.  If you don't want to use your name for privacy reasons, please choose an
alias that I can recognize as you.

Name your repository "introduction to interactive Media". 

- Edit your README.md file
	- What is README.md?
	- What is .md?
- Simple Markdown 
	- **Bold**
	- Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line
	- Inserting images: ![](media/eye-calipers.jpg)
	- Always remember to commit your changes!
	- More [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources).


##### Simple shapes in p5.js

Open [p5.js editor](editor.p5.js/)

- `ellipse()`
- `rect()`
- `createCanvas()`
- `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
- `line()`
- `point()`

What does this all mean?
- Functions
- Arguments or parameters

Controlling color, fill, and stroke

- `stroke()`
- `noStroke()`
- `fill()`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 180)`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, radians(180), CHORD)`

Here is the program we developed in class:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600,600); 
  background(25, 130, 80); 
  
  // draw a circle and a rectangle with the default colors
  circle (width/2, height/2, 50);
  rect(10, 10, 80, 20);
  
  // change the stroke and fill
  fill(180,0,0);
  stroke(0,0,180);
  // circle(80, 80, 80); this circle is commented out so it won't be drawn
  ellipse(200, 280, 50, 80);
  
  // change the stroke color but keep the same fill
  stroke(180,0,0);
  line( 0,0, 300, 100);
  
  let foo = radians(90);
  prlet(foo);                  //!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS VERY USEFUL!!!!!!!
  
  arc(50, 55, // center of the ellipse
      50, 50, // width and height
      0, radians(180)); // start and stop angle
  
  triangle( 100, 100, 10, 200, 100, 300);
  polet(width/2, height/2);
}

let x = 0;
function draw() {
	// Where am I poleting?
  prlet(mouseX, mouseY);
  
	// I can do animation!
  circle(x, 500, 40);
  x=x+1;
}

````
**Notes**
- Built-in variables
	- `width`, `height`, `mouseX`, `mouseY`
	- many others; we will discover more as we go along

**Notice that when working in the web editor your sketches are not
saved!**
- You can create an account on p5.js if you wish for your own use
but all class assignments must be handed in on Github.
- Github is designed to save works in progress. It is not only permissible to
	save unfinished work, it is advisable so that work doesn't get lost
- Github tracks changes so you can go back to any previous commit
- This saves you from having multiple versions of a program on your laptop
- You can even compare different commits to see what changes you made 
	between them

##### Saving a sketch to Github

- Navigate to desired folder
- Click on "Add file" 
- Select "Create new file"
- Type in optional new folder(s) followed by slashes `/` followed by a file
	name
- Copy your code from the p5.js editor and paste it into Github
- Scroll down to the bottom
- Optionally change the commit comment
- Click on "Commit new file"

### February 1

#### Homework
Look at self portraits

#### Questions
Did any questions come up since we last met?

##### Variables

- Javascript is not a typed language: you don't need to declare
	a variable's type
- `let myNumber = 4.5;`
- `let myString = "the quick brown fox";`
- `let myArray = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"];`
- `let myRandomNumber = random(255);`
- `let myRandomNumber = round(random(255));`
How can we find out what a variable's value is?
`print()` 

##### Animation

Use the `draw()` function to draw something different in each frame. This can
be the location of a shape but you can manipulate anything such as color also:

The  `draw()` function is called once per frame. Think of it as drawing a new
page on a ["flip book"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_book)

````
let foo = 0;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  foo = foo + 1;
}
````

By default, the previous frame is not erased. Sometimes this is useful.
Use the `background()` function to "paint" over any previous drawings. 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 500);
}

let triangleTopLeftX = 0;
let redValue = 255;

function draw() {
  // erase previous drawings
  background(10, 255, 255);

  // Move the triangle
  triangleTopLeftX = triangleTopLeftX + 1;

	// If the triangle reaches the right edge, move to the left edge
  if (triangleTopLeftX >= width) {
    triangleTopLeftX = 0;
  }

  // Change the value of red
  redValue = redValue - 1;

	//If red reaches a certian level, reset it
  if (redValue === 55) {
		redValue = 255;
	}

  // Select the fill for the triangle
  fill(redValue, redValue - 100, redValue - 100);

  // Draw the triangle
  triangle(
    triangleTopLeftX,
    20, // top left corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 100,
    30, // top right corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 50,
    200
  ); // bottom corner
  
  // Select the fill for the circle
  fill(10,20, 240);

  // Draw the circle
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 30);
  print("mouse coordinates = " + mouseX + ", " + mouseY);
}

````

##### Notes:

- Local vs. Global variables
- Built-in variables

````
// Example usage of a global variable

let count; // this is now a global variable

function setup() {
  circle(50, 50, 30);
  count = 7; // the variable is initialized here
}

function draw() {
  count = count + 1; // not algebra!
  // The result of the right hand side calculation
  // replaces whatever value was stored in the variable
  // on the left side of the '=' sign
  // end result: the variable "count" is incremented by 1

  print (count);
}
````

##### What is `frameRate()`?

````
function setup() {
  frameRate(10);       // frameRate() is a function
  print(frameRate()); // it takes awhile for the frame rate to change
}

function draw() {
  print(frameRate());
}
````

- **Record Zoom!**
- Please say something if I forget the end of class

	- Cameras on
	- Notifications off

##### Review

- conditionals 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed === true) {
    background(color(0, 0, 255));
  } else {
    background(color(200, 0, 0));
  }
}
````

**Notes**:
1. `mouseIsPressed` is another built-in variable. There are many others.
1. `mouseIsPressed` is a new type of data, namely a `boolean`, 
	which means it has
	 only one of two values, `true` or `false`
1. Note that `{` and `}` indicate the blocks
1. The `else` part of an `if()` statement is optional (what happens if we
	 remove it?)

In class exercise:
- Using the cursor to draw
- Now use a mouse press to clear the screen
- Clear the screen if the mouse is pressed inside a certain circle
- Combine these to create a primitive painting program

##### Loops
`while()` is like `if()` but it keeps on doing it as long as condition is true

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  let foo = 50; // create and initialize a variable

  while (foo < width) { // keep going as long as the condition is true
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
		// modify the variable so something different happens next time
    foo = foo + 50; 
  }
}
````

1. You should get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your variables.
	1. What is a better name for the variable foo?
1. What would happen if you replace the `while()` with `if()`?

There is another way to make a loop using the keyword `for()`. The `for()`
loop structure combines the initialization step and the incrementation step
into the `for()` loop construction:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  }
}
````

Which should you use? Whichever is easier for you to understand. Remember that
**most of the time spent programming is fixing problems**, and **whatever you
understand best will probably have fewer problems**.

Both `for()` loops and `while()` loops can be nested, meaning a loop inside a
loop:

````

function setup() {
  createCanvas(700, 700);
  background(230);
  fill(0);

  let yPos = 0;
  let xPos = 0;

  for (yPos = 30; yPos < height; yPos=yPos + 40) {
    for (xPos = 20; xPos<width; xPos=xPos + 40) {
      circle(xPos,yPos, 5);
    }
  }
}

````

#### Functions

Every time you use one of the built-in 'commands', you are really using (or
more properly 'calling') a built-in function. Functions are a very important
building block of programming, and in addition to using built-in functions,
you can also create your own. In fact, you've already been doing that, when
you created the `setup()` and `draw()` functions. In the case of
`setup()` and `draw()` you have to use those names, but when you create other
functions you can make up your own names. Just like variables names, good 
function names make your programs easier to understand.

Why create your own functions?

- Reuse (if it's something you might do again)
- Clarity (remember your three important audiences: yourself, others learning
	from you, me when I grade your work)
- Easier to debug (what is debugging?)
	- One of the most powerful ways to approach
	a bug is to reproduce it with simplest possible example. 
	This is much easier when the thing that's causing
	the problem is already a function.
- Modularity
- Flexibility (with good choice of parameters)

Let's modify the example from last class to use a function. First let's draw a
house instead of a circle to make it a little more interesting:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    rect(foo, 50, 40, 40);
    line(foo, 50, foo+20, 30);
    line(foo+20, 30, foo+40, 50);
  }
}
````

Now let's make a function called `drawOneHouse()`. If we want to
draw a house at different locations, we need a way to tell
the function `drawOneHouse()` where to put the house. Functions accommodate
this by allowing us to pass information into the function by putting 
that information in the parenthesis. In the function, we store this
information in temporary variables that we can use in the function:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50) {
    drawOneHouseAt(foo);
  }
}

function drawOneHouseAt( x) {
  rect(x, 50, 40, 40);
  line(x, 50, x+20, 30);
  line(x+20, 30, x+40, 50);
}
````

**Notes**
1. I've said this before and I'll keep saying: 
	**Choose descriptive names for your variables and functions!** 
	`foo` is a bad name, `xPos` is a good name,
	 `houseXPos` is a better name.
1. The value of `foo` (50, 100, 150 ...) is the information passed to the
	 function so that the function can do it's work. The proper name for this
	 information is an **argument**
1. The variable `x` is a temporary variable that **only exists in the function**.
	 This variable is used to store the argument that was passed into the
	 function so that the function can do its work. Once the function is
	 finished, this variable is no longer needed and is destroyed. 
	 A variable used in this way is called a **parameter**
1. Functions may take zero, one, or multiple arguments. When you write 
	a function, you decide how many arguments you need. For example, we might
	have included the house size or roof height or house y location. (Of course
	when you use functions that someone else wrote 
	you must use the proper number of parameters.)
1. Functions can return information as well, for example the `random()`
	 function. Functions can either return one piece of information, or none.
	We will see later how to do this. 

#### Variable Scope (again)

````
let foo;  // this is a global variable, visible in all functions

function setup() {
  foo = 7;
}

function draw() {

  print(foo);

  let bar; // this is a local variable, visible only inside of draw()

  for (let i = 0; i < width/2; i++) { 
    // i is a local variable visible only inside this for() loop
    ellipse(i, height/2, 10,15);
  }
}
````

##### Discuss reading

##### Functions

Any questions about what we've covered already?

Functions that return a value: See the [reference page for
`return`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/return)

**Notes**
- Functions can take any number of arguments (or none), but can return at most
one

In class exercise:

1. Write a function that will take a single parameter
and draw a vertical line from the top of the canvas to the bottom
at the X coordinate indicated by the parameter
	1. In the `setup()` function test your function 
	at a couple of different locations
1. Write another function that will draw a **horizontal** line
at the indicated **Y** coordinate
	1. Test as before
1. Using these two functions, write a program in `setup()`
that draws a grid of lines at regular intervals on the canvas


#### Callback Functions

`MouseClicked()` [example](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseClicked) in
the reference section

**Notes**
- You never have to call **callback functions**. The p5.js system calls them
	for you when that event happens


````
const redLocationX = 40;
const redLocationY = 40;

const blueLocationX = 80;
const blueLocationY = 40;

const menuSizeX = 120
const menuSizeY = 80;

const circleDiameter = 40;
const backgroundColor = 240;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400,400);

  //prepare background
  background(backgroundColor);

  // Put a box around the menu. We won't be allowed to draw here
  rect(0,0, menuSizeX, menuSizeY);

  // draw red circle
  fill (255,0,0);
  circle(redLocationX, redLocationY, circleDiameter);

  // now blue
  fill (0, 0, 255);
  circle(blueLocationX, blueLocationY, circleDiameter);

  // initialize fill to green
  fill (0, 255, 0);

  // turn off stroke
  noStroke();

  // faster refresh rate makes line more solid
  frameRate(200);
}

function draw() {

  if (mouseIsPressed &&
      !mouseIsWithinRect(0, 0, menuSizeX, menuSizeY)) {
    circle(mouseX, mouseY, 15);
  }
}

function mouseClicked() {

   // Have we chosen red?
  if (mouseIsWithinCircle(redLocationX, redLocationY, circleDiameter/2)) {
    console.log("you chose red!");
    fill (255,0,0);
  }

  // Have we chosen blue?
  if (mouseIsWithinCircle(blueLocationX, blueLocationY, circleDiameter/2)) {
    console.log("you chose blue!");
    fill (0, 0, 255);
  }

}

function mouseIsWithinCircle( x, y, radius) {
  if (dist(mouseX, mouseY, x, y) < radius) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

function mouseIsWithinRect( x, y, sizeX, sizeY) {
  if (mouseX > x &&
      mouseX < x + sizeX &&
      mouseY > y &&
      mouseY < y + sizeY) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

````

**Notes**
- Operator precedence is [very
	complicated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence). It is best to put parenthesis to
	force the order you want.
