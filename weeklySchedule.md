### This document: Weekly Schedule

This includes:
- Weekly topic(s)
- Production assignments
- Reading assignments
- Projects


### Week 1 (Aug. 31 & Sept. 2nd)

Primitive shapes, Programming concepts

Install Processing on your computer: https://processing.org/download/

Assignments:

#### Production:

Due Sept. 7th (post documentation on Github): Make a self-portrait using Processing.
- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it)
- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice using the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named
`Sept7`
  - Upload your program into the new folder,
  with the extension `.pde`.
    - If you use any variables, chose good names.
  - Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
  - Create a `README.md` in the new folder and include
  your screenshot in the `README.md`.
  - Also in the `README.md`, describe any difficulties you had or anything
interesting you discovered.
- Email me a link to your repository (to the repository, not to this assignment)
- Post your self portrait to our Discord channel

#### Reading:

Due Sept. 7th:
- Read [Getting Started with
  Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted)
- Read [Coordinate Systems and
  Shapes](https://py.processing.org/tutorials/drawing/) (this is for Python but
	is identical for Processing)

### Week 2 (Sept. 7 & 9)

Animation, Conditionals, Loops

Assignments:

#### Production:

Due Sept. 14th: 

- Using loops (`for()` or `while()`) in some way, 
along with everything that you’ve learned so far, 
make a simple work of art. 
You may want to look at these old computer art magazines for inspiration, 
but you don’t need to make your so elaborate. 
Scroll through and look for images:

- In your Github repository, create a new folder named 
`Sept13`
	- Use **COMMAND T** or **CONTROL T** to indent your code properly
	- Upload your program into the new folder, 
	with the extension `.pde`. 
	- Your program should be well commented and organized. 
	- Excellent names for variables
	- Excellent names for functions, if you make any
	- Upload a screenshot of your artwork into the new folder
	- Create a `README.md` in the new folder and include 
	your screenshot in the `README.md`.

### todays-assignment
#### Reading assignment (Due Oct. 7th)
- Read Chapter 1 of 
[The Design of Everyday Things, The Psychopathology of Everyday
Things](http://pages.ucsd.edu/%7Emboyle/COGS1/readings/Norman-COGS1-The%20Psychopathology-of-Everyday-Things.pdf)
#### Production assignment (Due Oct. 13th
- Complete Midterm

### Week 7 (Oct. 12 & 14)

Midterm due – Oct. 14th

#### Assignments Due October 26

##### Production:
- Get your kit from the bookstore
- Install the Arduino IDE from here. If you are on Windows chose the Windows Installer.
-  Prepare a space for working with electronics
	- Have your kits ready to use in class
	- Have some space to work. There are many small components in the kit that will be easily lost, so ideally be seated at a table or desk with clear space around you.
	- In your kit is a bundle of jumper wires with a very tight ziptie that must be carefully removed. Please do this before class because it may take you a while to find the right tool. A sharp pair of scissors should work. A knife might damage the wires and hurt you.
		- Be careful not to damage the wires or yourselves!

##### Reading
- Sparkfun breadboard tutorial
- Microcontrollers, the basics
- Digital Input & Output

            A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design
            A follow-up article
        Read about the voltage divider. Don’t worry about the theory too much or the section on level shifting. The important thing is to absorb a little of the concept of a voltage divider.

### Week 10 (Nov. 9 & 11)

Sound, Servo motor, Mapping
#### Assignments:

##### Production:

Assignments:

    Production:
        Due Nov. 15th (post documentation on blog):  Make a musical instrument

### Week 11 (Nov. 16 & 18)

Serial Communication, introduce Final Project
#### Assignments:

##### Production:

Assignments:

    Production:
        Due Nov. 22nd (each person, not just one for a group, should post code for each exercise, and video of just the LED lighting up with the ball bouncing) Work in the groups from class to finish the three in-class examples exercises:
            make something that uses only one sensor  on arduino and makes the ellipse in processing move on the horizontal axis, in the middle of the screen, and nothing on arduino is controlled by processing
            make something that controls the LED brightness from processing
            take the gravity wind example (https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/blob/master/processingExamples/gravityExamples/gravityWind/gravityWind.pde) and make it so every time the ball bounces one led lights up and then turns off, and you can control the wind from one analog sensor
        Due Nov. 24th (post documentation on blog): Write a preliminary concept for your final project, which must incorporate both Arduino and Processing.
            Final project prompt (examples are listed on syllabus page)
                Create a physically interactive system of your choice that relies on a multimedia computer for some sort of processing or data analysis. The Final should use BOTH Processing AND Arduino.Your focus should be on careful and timely sensing of the relevant actions of the person or people that you’re designing this for, and on clear, prompt, and effective responses. Any interactive system is going to involve systems of listening, thinking, and speaking from both parties. Whether it involves one cycle or many, the exchange should be engaging.You may work alone or in groups.
        EXTRA CREDIT Due Nov. 24th (post documentation on blog): Make a simple game that involves some kind of communication between Arduino and Processing
