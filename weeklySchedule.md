Email me a link to your Github repository

##### Production:

Resources you might find useful:
1. Dan Shiffman's amazing [video
	 tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)
1. Learning section of [p5js.org](https://p5js.org/learn/)

Make a self-portrait using p5.js.
- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not
	interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no
	drawing using the mouse)
- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change
	while we look at it)
- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice using
	the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named `Feb1`
	- Upload your program into the new folder, with the extension `.js`.
		- If you use any variables, chose good names.
	- Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
	- Create a `README.md` in the new folder and include your screenshot in the
		`README.md`.
	- Also in the `README.md`, describe any difficulties you had or anything
		interesting you discovered.
- Post your self portrait to our Discord channel

#### Reading:

- Read [Get Started](https://p5js.org/get-started/). You can stop at 
	*Setting up p5.js with an editor on your own computer*
- Read [Color](https://p5js.org/learn/color.html)
- Read [Coordinate
	System](https://p5js.org/learn/coordinate-system-and-shapes.html)

- Using loops (`for()` or `while()`) in some way, 
along with everything that you’ve learned so far, 
make a simple work of art.

	around this problem

##### todays-assignment
#### Production Assignment progress Tuesday March 8

As you finish your project, Keep in mind the design considerations that we
learned about earlier in the semester: affordances, signifiers, etc. 
For instance, think about where you place buttons and other controls, and how
you signify their functions.

I suggest that you aim to finish your project by Tuesday or Wednesday, leaving
you a couple of days for user testing. See if your users can play the game
without any additional instructions from you; the game should be self
explanatory. Observe them playing, take notes, and request feedback, and see
how you can improve.

On Tuesday we will do a quick status check in class, and I 
I expect each of you to demonstrate your project complete 
or very nearly complete. 

#### Production Assignment Due Thursday March 10
Finish the midterm

Midterm project

Make a game using everything you have learned so far
- Can be one or more players
- The game must not be violent (no shooting or fighting)
- Must include
	- At least one shape
	- At least one image
	- At least one sound
	- At least one on-screen text
	- Object Oriented Programming
- The game must start with a screen giving instructions, and must wait there
	until a button or key (your choice) is pressed
- After the game is won or lost, there must be a way to restart the game
	without closing and restarting the program
- A sense of humor and whimsy is encouraged. Think outside the box, don't be
	traditional
- Keep in mind the design considerations that we learned about earlier in the semester: affordances, signifiers, etc
- Documentation must be excellent
	- Include photos, sketches, GIFS as appropriate
- Code must be extremely well organized and commented
	- Include block at the beginning of the code
		with your name, name of the project, class, and date
	- Explain each function except for setup() and draw()
		- What does it do
		- What the arguments are
		- How it works
	- Tidy the code
		- Unfortunately this also join all the arguments in a function 
			so if broke any long lines to make them fit in the window
			you will have to do it again
	- Excellent comments, especially for any confusing or tricky parts
	- Use functions as needed to organize your program
	- Use excellent variable, function, object, and class names

#### Production Assignment Due Thursday March 10

- Perform user testing on your game
- Solicit feedback
- Implement suggestions that you feel are relevant
