### This document: Weekly Schedule

This includes:
- Weekly topic(s)
- Production assignments
- Reading assignments
- Projects


### Week 1 (Aug. 31 & Sept. 2nd)

Primitive shapes, Programming concepts

Install Processing on your computer: https://processing.org/download/

Assignments:

#### Production:

Due Sept. 7th (post documentation on Github): Make a self-portrait using Processing.
- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it)
- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice using the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named
`Sept7`
  - Upload your program into the new folder,
  with the extension `.pde`.
    - If you use any variables, chose good names.
  - Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
  - Create a `README.md` in the new folder and include
  your screenshot in the `README.md`.
  - Also in the `README.md`, describe any difficulties you had or anything
interesting you discovered.
- Email me a link to your repository (to the repository, not to this assignment)
- Post your self portrait to our Discord channel

#### Reading:

Due Sept. 7th:
- Read [Getting Started with
  Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted)
- Read [Coordinate Systems and
  Shapes](https://py.processing.org/tutorials/drawing/) (this is for Python but
	is identical for Processing)

##### Reading


Read Chapter 1 of 
[The Design of Everyday Things, The Psychopathology of Everyday
Things](http://pages.ucsd.edu/%7Emboyle/COGS1/readings/Norman-COGS1-The%20Psychopathology-of-Everyday-Things.pdf)

### Week 6 (Oct. 5 & 7)

Things](http://pages.ucsd.edu/%7Emboyle/COGS1/readings/Norman-COGS1-The%20Psychopathology-of-Everyday-Things.pdf)
#### Production assignment (Due Oct. 14th)
- Complete Midterm

### Week 7 (Oct. 12 & 14)

Midterm due – Oct. 14th

#### Assignments Due October 26

##### Production:
- Get your kit from the bookstore
- You will need a USB-A port. If you have a modern laptop with only USB-C
	ports, you will need to borrow (from Academic Tech if you are on campus) or
	buy (if you are off-campus) a USB-A to USB-C adapter.
- Prepare a space for working with electronics
	- Have your kits ready to use in class
	- Have some space to work. There are many small components in the kit that
	will be easily lost, so ideally be seated at a table or desk with clear
	space around you.
- Install the Arduino IDE from
	[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). 
	If you are on Windows chose either the 
	Windows Installer ("Windows Win 7 and newer")
	or install from 
	the Microsoft App Store ("Windows app Win 8.1 or 10")
- In your kit is a bundle of jumper wires 
that might be tied with a very tight ziptie 
	that must be carefully removed. Please do this before class because 
	it may take you a while to find the right tool. 
	A sharp pair of scissors should work. A knife might damage the wires 
	and hurt you.

![](media/jumpersWithCableTieRemoved.jpg)

- **Be careful not to damage the wires or yourselves!**

- (If you are curious, you may read all about the kit
	[here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v41))

Serial Communication, introduce Final Project

##### Production Assignments Due Thursday November 25

makes the ellipse in Processing move on the horizontal axis, 
in the middle of the screen, and nothing on Arduino is controlled by Processing
1. Make something that controls the LED brightness from Processing
1. Take the gravity wind example (https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/blob/master/processingExamples/gravityExamples/gravityWind/gravityWind.pde) and make it so every time the ball bounces one led lights up and then turns off, and you can control the wind from one analog sensor
1. EXTRA CREDIT Due Nov. 24th 
- Make a simple game that involves some
kind of communication between Arduino and Processing

Document everything as usual in your Github repository

##### Writing Assignments Due Thursday November 25

Write a preliminary concept for your final project, which must incorporate both Arduino and Processing.

Final project prompt (examples are listed on syllabus page)

Create a physically interactive system of your choice that relies on a
multimedia computer for some sort of processing or data analysis. The final
project
should use BOTH Processing AND Arduino.Your focus should be on careful and
timely sensing of the relevant actions of the person or people that you’re
designing this for, and on clear, prompt, and effective responses. Any
interactive system is going to involve systems of listening, thinking, and
speaking from both parties. Whether it involves one cycle or many, the
exchange should be engaging.You may work alone or in groups.
