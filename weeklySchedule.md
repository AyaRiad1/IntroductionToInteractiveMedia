1. Learning section of [p5js.org](https://p5js.org/learn/)

Make a self-portrait using p5.js.
- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not
	interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no
	drawing using the mouse)
- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change
	while we look at it)
- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice using
	the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named `Feb1`
	- Upload your program into the new folder, with the extension `.js`.
		- If you use any variables, chose good names.
	- Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
	- Create a `README.md` in the new folder and include your screenshot in the
		`README.md`.
	- Also in the `README.md`, describe any difficulties you had or anything
		interesting you discovered.
- Post your self portrait to our Discord channel
